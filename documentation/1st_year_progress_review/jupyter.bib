	abstract = {Using successful genome-wide association results in psychiatry for drug repurposing is an ongoing challenge. Databases collecting drug targets and gene annotations are growing and can be harnessed to shed a new light on psychiatric disorders. We used genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics from the Psychiatric Genetics Consortium (PGC) Schizophrenia working group to build a drug repositioning model for schizophrenia. As sample size increases, schizophrenia GWAS results show increasing enrichment for known antipsychotic drugs, selective calcium channel blockers, and antiepileptics. Each of these therapeutical classes targets different gene subnetworks. We identify 123 Bonferroni-significant druggable genes outside the MHC, and 128 FDR-significant biological pathways related to neurons, synapses, genic intolerance, membrane transport, epilepsy, and mental disorders. These results suggest that, in schizophrenia, current well-powered GWAS results can reliably detect known schizophrenia drugs and thus may hold considerable potential for the identification of new therapeutic leads. Moreover, antiepileptics and calcium channel blockers may provide repurposing opportunities. This study also reveals significant pathways in schizophrenia that were not identified previously, and provides a workflow for pathway analysis and drug repurposing using GWAS results.},

	abstract = {Objective

We have investigated the polygenic architecture of Parkinson disease (PD) and have also explored the potential relationship between an individual's polygenic risk score and their disease age at onset.


Methods

This study used genotypic data from 4,294 cases and 10,340 controls obtained from the meta-analysis of PD genome-wide association studies. Polygenic score analysis was performed as previously described by the International Schizophrenia Consortium, testing whether the polygenic score alleles identified in 1 association study were significantly enriched in the cases relative to the controls of 3 independent studies. Linear regression was used to investigate the relationship between an individual's polygenic score for PD risk alleles and disease age at onset.


Results

Our polygenic score analysis has identified significant evidence for a polygenic component enriched in the cases of each of 3 independent PD genome-wide association cohorts (minimum p = 3.76 × 10−6). Further analysis identified compelling evidence that the average polygenic score in patients with an early disease age at onset was significantly higher than in those with a late age at onset (p = 0.00014).


Interpretation

This provides strong support for a large polygenic contribution to the overall heritable risk of PD and also suggests that early onset forms of the illness are not exclusively caused by highly penetrant Mendelian mutations, but can also be contributed to by an accumulation of common polygenic alleles with relatively low effect sizes.

Yet, given the incompleteness of the interactome and the limited knowledge of disease-associated genes, it is not obvious if the available data have sufficient coverage to map out modules associated with each disease. Here we derive mathematical conditions for the identifiability of disease modules and show that the network-based location of each disease module determines its pathobiological relationship to other diseases. For example, diseases with overlapping network modules show significant coexpression patterns, symptom similarity, and comorbidity, whereas diseases residing in separated network neighborhoods are phenotypically distinct. These tools represent an interactome-based platform to predict molecular commonalities between phenotypically related diseases, even if they do not share primary disease genes.},

These methods can be used when the effects of individual markers is too weak to detect, which is a common problem when studying polygenic traits. Moreover, gene-set analysis can provide additional insight into functional and biological mechanisms underlying the genetic component of a trait. Although a number of methods for gene and gene-set analysis are available however, they generally suffer from various statistical issues and can be very time-consuming to run. We have therefore developed a new method called MAGMA to address these issues, and have compared it to a number of existing tools. Our results show that MAGMA detects more associated genes and gene-sets than other methods, and is also considerably faster. The way the method is set up also makes it highly flexible. This makes it suitable as a basis for more general statistical analyses aimed at investigating more complex research questions.},

The structures of 3,665 FDA-approved and investigational drugs were computationally screened against hundreds of protein targets as defined by the ligands that bind to them. Chemical similarities between the drugs and various sets of ligands predicted thousands of off-target associations, some of which were confirmed in pharmacological assays.

	abstract = {Loss-of-function mutations protective against human disease provide in vivo validation of therapeutic targets, but none have yet been described for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Through sequencing or genotyping of {\textasciitilde}150,000 individuals across 5 ancestry groups, we identified 12 rare protein-truncating variants in SLC30A8, which encodes an islet zinc transporter (ZnT8) and harbors a common variant (p.Trp325Arg) associated with T2D risk and glucose and proinsulin levels. Collectively, carriers of protein-truncating variants had 65\% reduced T2D risk (P = 1.7 × 10(-6)), and non-diabetic Icelandic carriers of a frameshift variant (p.Lys34Serfs*50) demonstrated reduced glucose levels (-0.17 s.d., P = 4.6 × 10(-4)). The two most common protein-truncating variants (p.Arg138* and p.Lys34Serfs*50) individually associate with T2D protection and encode unstable ZnT8 proteins. Previous functional study of SLC30A8 suggested that reduced zinc transport increases T2D risk, and phenotypic heterogeneity was observed in mouse Slc30a8 knockouts. In contrast, loss-of-function mutations in humans provide strong evidence that SLC30A8 haploinsufficiency protects against T2D, suggesting ZnT8 inhibition as a therapeutic strategy in T2D prevention.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Guidelines recommend statins as first-line therapy for dyslipidemia. Monoclonal antibodies targeting proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a new lipid-lowering approach.
PURPOSE: To assess the efficacy and safety of PCSK9 antibodies in adults with hypercholesterolemia.
DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, PubMed Central, and Google Scholar; conference proceedings; and the ClinicalTrials.gov registry through 4 April 2015.
STUDY SELECTION: Phase 2 or 3 randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) comparing treatment using PCSK9 antibodies with no anti-PCSK9 therapy in adults with hypercholesterolemia.
DATA EXTRACTION: Two investigators independently extracted data on study characteristics and lipid and clinical outcomes, and rated risk of bias of trials. Prespecified primary end points were all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.
DATA SYNTHESIS: Twenty-four RCTs comprising 10 159 patients were included. Compared with no antibody, treatment with PCSK9 antibodies led to marked reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (mean difference, -47.49\% [95\% CI, -69.64\% to -25.35\%]; P {\textless} 0.001] and other atherogenic lipid fractions, and it reduced all-cause mortality (odds ratio [OR], 0.45 [CI, 0.23 to 0.86]; P = 0.015; heterogeneity P = 0.63; I2 = 0\%) and cardiovascular mortality (OR, 0.50 [CI, 0.23 to 1.10]; P = 0.084; heterogeneity P = 0.78; I2 = 0\%). The rate of myocardial infarction was significantly reduced with use of PCSK9 antibodies (OR, 0.49 [CI, 0.26 to 0.93]; P = 0.030; heterogeneity P = 0.45; I2 = 0\%), and increases in the serum creatine kinase level were reduced (OR, 0.72 [CI, 0.54 to 0.96]; P = 0.026; heterogeneity P = 0.65; I2 = 0\%). Serious adverse events did not increase with administration of PCSK9 antibodies.
LIMITATION: Results were derived from study-level data rather than patient-level data, and clinical outcome data are rare.
CONCLUSION: PCSK9 antibodies seem to be safe and effective for adults with dyslipidemia.

	abstract = {Summary
Inhibition of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 serine protease (PCSK9) resulted in large reductions of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in phase 1 trials. We assessed the efficacy and safety of various doses and dosing intervals of REGN727, a monoclonal antibody to PCSK9, added to statins, to further lower LDL-C in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia. This multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial was done at 16 lipid clinics in the USA and Canada. Between Jan 18, 2011, and Nov 7, 2011, we enrolled adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia and LDL-C concentrations of 2·6 mmol/L or higher on stable diet and statin dose, with or without ezetimibe. Patients were randomly assigned to receive REGN727 150 mg, 200 mg, or 300 mg every 4 weeks, or 150 mg every 2 weeks, or placebo every 2 weeks (ratio 1:1:1:1:1). Randomisation was stratified by concomitant use of ezetimibe at baseline. Investigators, study staff, and patients were masked to treatment group. Blinding was maintained by administration of placebo alternating with REGN727 for the groups of 4 week dosing. The primary endpoint was mean percent reduction in LDL-C from baseline at week 12 and was analysed in the modified intention-to-treat population with an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment group. This trial is registered in ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT 01266876. 77 patients were randomly assigned to study groups (15–16 patients per group) and all were analysed. Least-squares (LS) mean LDL-C reduction from baseline to week 12 was 28·9\% (SE 5·08) for 150 mg every 4 weeks (p=0·0113), 31·54\% (4·91) for 200 mg every 4 weeks (p=0·0035), 42·53\% (5·09) for 300 mg every 4 weeks (p{\textless}0·0001), and 67·90\% (4·85) for 150 mg every 2 weeks (p{\textless}0·0001), compared with 10·65\% (5·04) with placebo. One serious adverse event was reported with placebo and none with REGN727. No increases of more than three times the upper limit of normal were reported for hepatic transaminases or creatinine kinase. The most common adverse event was injection-site reaction with one patient in the group of 300 mg REGN727 terminating treatment. REGN727 was well tolerated and achieved substantial further LDL-C reduction in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia and elevated LDL-C treated with high-dose statins, with or without ezetimibe. REGN727 has the potential to provide optimum control of LDL-C in patients with this disorder. Sanofi US and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Incorporated.},

	abstract = {Summary
Therapeutic treatments for schizophrenia do not alleviate symptoms for all patients and efficacy is limited by common, often severe, side-effects. Genetic studies of disease can identify novel drug targets, and drugs for which the mechanism has direct genetic support have increased likelihood of clinical success. Large-scale genetic studies of schizophrenia have increased the number of genes and gene sets associated with risk. We aimed to examine the overlap between schizophrenia risk loci and gene targets of a comprehensive set of medications to potentially inform and improve treatment of schizophrenia. We defined schizophrenia risk loci as genomic regions reaching genome-wide significance in the latest Psychiatric Genomics Consortium schizophrenia genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 36 989 cases and 113 075 controls and loss of function variants observed only once among 5079 individuals in an exome-sequencing study of 2536 schizophrenia cases and 2543 controls (Swedish Schizophrenia Study). Using two large and orthogonally created databases, we collated drug targets into 167 gene sets targeted by pharmacologically similar drugs and examined enrichment of schizophrenia risk loci in these sets. We further linked the exome-sequenced data with a national drug registry (the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register) to assess the contribution of rare variants to treatment response, using clozapine prescription as a proxy for treatment resistance. We combined results from testing rare and common variation and, after correction for multiple testing, two gene sets were associated with schizophrenia risk: agents against amoebiasis and other protozoal diseases (106 genes, p=0·00046, pcorrected =0·024) and antipsychotics (347 genes, p=0·00078, pcorrected=0·046). Further analysis pointed to antipsychotics as having independent enrichment after removing genes that overlapped these two target sets. We noted significant enrichment both in known targets of antipsychotics (70 genes, p=0·0078) and novel predicted targets (277 genes, p=0·019). Patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia had an excess of rare disruptive variants in gene targets of antipsychotics (347 genes, p=0·0067) and in genes with evidence for a role in antipsychotic efficacy (91 genes, p=0·0029). Our results support genetic overlap between schizophrenia pathogenesis and antipsychotic mechanism of action. This finding is consistent with treatment efficacy being polygenic and suggests that single-target therapeutics might be insufficient. We provide evidence of a role for rare functional variants in antipsychotic treatment response, pointing to a subset of patients where their genetic information could inform treatment. Finally, we present a novel framework for identifying treatments from genetic data and improving our understanding of therapeutic mechanism. US National Institutes of Health.},

	abstract = {Background

We aimed to identify the genetic cause of neurological disease in an Iranian family whose manifestations include symptoms of parkinsonism and cognitive dysfunction.


Methods

Clinical data on the patients were gathered by interviews with parents, neurological examinations, and laboratory tests. Genetic analysis was performed by genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism homozygosity mapping and exome sequencing. The effect of putative disease-causing mutation was assessed by immunocytochemistry on HEK293 cells and Western blotting on proteins extracted from HEK293 cells transfected with wild-type and mutated genes.


Results

Homozygosity mapping and exome sequencing led to identification of a mutation in ADORA1 that causes p.Gly279Ser in the encoded protein, adenosine A1 receptor (A1R), as the probable cause of disease. The mutation segregated with disease status in the family, affects a highly conserved amino acid, and was absent in 700 controls.


Conclusions

The known biological activities of A1R in brain functions including its physical interaction with and inhibitory effect on dopamine receptor D1 provide supportive evidence that disruptions of A1R may result in neurological dysfunction. Also, recent evidence on the related adenosine A2B receptor marks the domain in which the mutation is positioned as important for function. Finally, ADORA1 is located within the Parkinson's disease locus PARK16, which has been identified in several populations. ADORA1 may be the PD susceptibility gene within this locus. The molecular mechanism by which p.Gly279Ser disrupts A1R function remains unknown, but a quantitative effect on interaction with the dopamine receptor was not shown. © 2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society},

Homozygozity mapping and exome sequencing in 62 isolated individuals with early-onset parkinsonism and confirmed consanguinity followed by data mining in the exomes of 1,348 PD-affected individuals identified, in three isolated subjects, homozygous or compound heterozygous truncating mutations in vacuolar protein sorting 13C (VPS13C). VPS13C mutations are associated with a distinct form of early-onset parkinsonism characterized by rapid and severe disease progression and early cognitive decline; the pathological features were striking and reminiscent of diffuse Lewy body disease. In cell models, VPS13C partly localized to the outer membrane of mitochondria. Silencing of VPS13C was associated with lower mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial fragmentation, increased respiration rates, exacerbated PINK1/Parkin-dependent mitophagy, and transcriptional upregulation of PARK2 in response to mitochondrial damage. This work suggests that loss of function of VPS13C is a cause of autosomal-recessive early-onset parkinsonism with a distinctive phenotype of rapid and severe progression.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Parkinson disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease for which susceptibility is linked to genetic and environmental risk factors.
OBJECTIVE: To identify genetic variants contributing to disease risk in familial PD.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A 2-stage study design that included a discovery cohort of families with PD and a replication cohort of familial probands was used. In the discovery cohort, rare exonic variants that segregated in multiple affected individuals in a family and were predicted to be conserved or damaging were retained. Genes with retained variants were prioritized if expressed in the brain and located within PD-relevant pathways. Genes in which prioritized variants were observed in at least 4 families were selected as candidate genes for replication in the replication cohort. The setting was among individuals with familial PD enrolled from academic movement disorder specialty clinics across the United States. All participants had a family history of PD.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Identification of genes containing rare, likely deleterious, genetic variants in individuals with familial PD using a 2-stage exome sequencing study design.
RESULTS: The 93 individuals from 32 families in the discovery cohort (49.5\% [46 of 93] female) had a mean (SD) age at onset of 61.8 (10.0) years. The 49 individuals with familial PD in the replication cohort (32.6\% [16 of 49] female) had a mean (SD) age at onset of 50.1 (15.7) years. Discovery cohort recruitment dates were 1999 to 2009, and replication cohort recruitment dates were 2003 to 2014. Data analysis dates were 2011 to 2015. Three genes containing a total of 13 rare and potentially damaging variants were prioritized in the discovery cohort. Two of these genes (TNK2 and TNR) also had rare variants that were predicted to be damaging in the replication cohort. All 9 variants identified in the 2 replicated genes in 12 families across the discovery and replication cohorts were confirmed via Sanger sequencing.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: TNK2 and TNR harbored rare, likely deleterious, variants in individuals having familial PD, with similar findings in an independent cohort. To our knowledge, these genes have not been previously associated with PD, although they have been linked to critical neuronal functions. Further studies are required to confirm a potential role for these genes in the pathogenesis of PD.},

DNAJC6 mutations were recently described in two families with autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism (onset age {\textless} 11), prominent atypical signs, poor or absent response to levodopa, and rapid progression (wheelchair-bound within ∼10 years from onset). Here, for the first time, we report DNAJC6 mutations in early-onset Parkinson's disease (PD).


Methods

The DNAJC6 open reading frame was analyzed in 274 patients with early-onset sporadic or familial PD. Selected variants were followed up by cosegregation, homozygosity mapping, linkage analysis, whole-exome sequencing, and protein studies.


Results

We identified two families with different novel homozygous DNAJC6 mutations segregating with PD. In each family, the DNAJC6 mutation was flanked by long runs of homozygosity within highest linkage peaks. Exome sequencing did not detect additional pathogenic variants within the linkage regions. In both families, patients showed severely decreased steady-state levels of the auxilin protein in fibroblasts. We also identified a sporadic patient carrying two rare noncoding DNAJC6 variants possibly effecting RNA splicing. All these cases fulfilled the criteria for a clinical diagnosis of early-onset PD, had symptoms onset in the third-to-fifth decade, and slow disease progression. Response to dopaminergic therapies was prominent, but, in some patients, limited by psychiatric side effects. The phenotype overlaps that of other monogenic forms of early-onset PD.


Interpretation

Our findings delineate a novel form of hereditary early-onset PD. Screening of DNAJC6 is warranted in all patients with early-onset PD compatible with autosomal recessive inheritance. Our data provide further evidence for the involvement of synaptic vesicles endocytosis and trafficking in PD pathogenesis. Ann Neurol 2016;79:244–256},

Since our last update in 2014, we have more than doubled the number of reference proteomes to 5631, giving a greater coverage of taxonomic diversity. We implemented a pipeline to remove redundant highly similar proteomes that were causing excessive redundancy in UniProt. The initial run of this pipeline reduced the number of sequences in UniProt by 47 million. For our users interested in the accessory proteomes, we have made available sets of pan proteome sequences that cover the diversity of sequences for each species that is found in its strains and sub-strains. To help interpretation of genomic variants, we provide tracks of detailed protein information for the major genome browsers. We provide a SPARQL endpoint that allows complex queries of the more than 22 billion triples of data in UniProt (http://sparql.uniprot.org/).

	abstract = {Multiple-hypothesis testing involves guarding against much more complicated errors than single-hypothesis testing. Whereas we typically control the type I error rate for a single-hypothesis test, a compound error rate is controlled for multiple-hypothesis tests. For example, controlling the false discovery rate FDR traditionally involves intricate sequential p-value rejection methods based on the observed data. Whereas a sequential p-value method fixes the error rate and estimates its corresponding rejection region, we propose the opposite approach-we fix the rejection region and then estimate its corresponding error rate. This new approach offers increased applicability, accuracy and power. We apply the methodology to both the positive false discovery rate pFDR and FDR, and provide evidence for its benefits. It is shown that pFDR is probably the quantity of interest over FDR. Also discussed is the calculation of the q-value, the pFDR analogue of the p-value, which eliminates the need to set the error rate beforehand as is traditionally done. Some simple numerical examples are presented that show that this new approach can yield an increase of over eight times in power compared with the Benjamini-Hochberg FDR method.},

	abstract = {SummaryThe effect of the synthetic retinoid acitretin (A) on the disposition of blood glucose and on the serum insulin response following the IV infusion of 139 mmol glucose over 10 min (IGTT) has been investigated in six healthy subjects. The IGTT was performed on Days 1, 10 and 24. On Days 3 to 10 A 50 mg/d was administered. Several parameters of glucose disposition and insulin response (K-values, AUC) were assessed. As a methodological variant, the profiles over time of blood glucose and serum insulin were evaluated by model calculations using the ‘minimal model’. Acitretin did not influence any parameter of glucose disposition. The area under the insulin-time curve (baseline corrected) was significantly decreased from 1.20 mU·min·l−1 on Day 1 to 0.89 mU·min·l−1 on Day 10, and was 0.91 mU·min·l−1 on Day 24. The model-derived ‘insulin sensitivity’ increased from 13·10−4 l·mU−1·min−1 on Day 1 to 20·10−4 l·mU−1·min−1 on Day 10 and was 18·10−4 l·mU−1·min−1 on Day 24. The results suggest that A increased sensitivity to endogenous insulin. It supports a recent report showing greater insulin sensitivity in patients treated with the synthetic retinoid etretinate.},

Clinicians often wonder what effect it has on blood pressure and whether they are safe in hypertensive patients. The purpose of our systematic review was to assess whether these drugs cause clinically meaningful elevations in pulse or blood pressure. English-language, randomized, placebo-controlled trials of oral phenylpropanolamine in adults with extractable data on pulse or blood pressure were studied. MEDLINE (1966-2003), Embase, the Cochrane library and reviewed article references were used as sources. Systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate data were extracted. Additional extracted data included demographics, year, study design, study duration, drug dose and frequency, duration of washout and country. Study quality was assessed using the methods of Jadad and data were synthesized using a random effects model using weighted mean differences. In all, 33 trials reporting 48 treatment arms with 2165 patients were included. Phenylpropanolamine increased SBP 5.5 mmHg (95\% CI: 3.1-8.0) and DBP 4.1 mmHg (95\% CI: 2.2-6.0) with no effect on pulse. Patients with controlled hypertension were not at greater risk of blood pressure elevation. Immediate release preparations had greater effects on blood pressure than sustained release ones. Higher doses and shorter duration use also caused greater increases. Eighteen studies contained at least one treated subjects having blood pressure elevations {\textgreater} or =140/90 mmHg, an increase in SBP {\textgreater} or =15 mmHg or an increase in DBP {\textgreater} or =10 mmHg. In conclusion, phenylpropanolamine caused a small, but significant increase in systolic blood pressure. The effect was more pronounced with shorter-term administration, higher doses of medication and immediate release formulations.},

	abstract = {Background Helicobacter pylori, a lifelong and typically asymptomatic infection of the stomach, profoundly alters gastric immune responses, and may benefit the host in protection against other pathogens. We explored the hypothesis that H. pylori contributes to the control of infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis.  Methodology/Principal Findings We first examined M. tuberculosis-specific IFN-γ and H. pylori antibody responses in 339 healthy Northern Californians undergoing routine tuberculin skin testing. Of 97 subjects (29\%) meeting criteria for latent tuberculosis (TB) infection (LTBI), 45 (46\%) were H. pylori seropositive. Subjects with LTBI who were H. pylori-seropositive had 1.5-fold higher TB antigen-induced IFN-γ responses (p = 0.04, ANOVA), and a more Th-1 like cytokine profile in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, compared to those who were H. pylori seronegative. To explore an association between H. pylori infection and clinical outcome of TB exposure, we evaluated H. pylori seroprevalence in baseline samples from two high risk TB case-contact cohorts, and from cynomolgus macaques experimentally challenged with M. tuberculosis. Compared to 513 household contacts who did not progress to active disease during a median 24 months follow-up, 120 prevalent TB cases were significantly less likely to be H. pylori infected (AOR: 0.55, 95\% CI 0.0.36–0.83, p = 0.005), though seroprevalence was not significantly different from non-progressors in 37 incident TB cases (AOR: 1.35 [95\% CI 0.63–2.9] p = 0.44). Cynomolgus macaques with natural H. pylori infection were significantly less likely to progress to TB 6 to 8 months after M. tuberculosis challenge (RR: 0.31 [95\% CI 0.12–0.80], p = 0.04).  Conclusions/Significance H. pylori infection may induce bystander effects that modify the risk of active TB in humans and non-human primates. That immunity to TB may be enhanced by exposure to other microbial agents may have important implications for vaccine development and disease control.},
