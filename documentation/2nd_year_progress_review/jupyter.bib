	doi = {10.7717/peerj.3544},
	abstract = {The widespread use of ‘statistical significance’ as a license for making a claim of a scientific finding leads to considerable distortion of the scientific process (according to the American Statistical Association). We review why degrading p-values into ‘significant’ and ‘nonsignificant’ contributes to making studies irreproducible, or to making them seem irreproducible. A major problem is that we tend to take small p-values at face value, but mistrust results with larger p-values. In either case, p-values tell little about reliability of research, because they are hardly replicable even if an alternative hypothesis is true. Also significance (p ≤ 0.05) is hardly replicable: at a good statistical power of 80\%, two studies will be ‘conflicting’, meaning that one is significant and the other is not, in one third of the cases if there is a true effect. A replication can therefore not be interpreted as having failed only because it is nonsignificant. Many apparent replication failures may thus reflect faulty judgment based on significance thresholds rather than a crisis of unreplicable research. Reliable conclusions on replicability and practical importance of a finding can only be drawn using cumulative evidence from multiple independent studies. However, applying significance thresholds makes cumulative knowledge unreliable. One reason is that with anything but ideal statistical power, significant effect sizes will be biased upwards. Interpreting inflated significant results while ignoring nonsignificant results will thus lead to wrong conclusions. But current incentives to hunt for significance lead to selective reporting and to publication bias against nonsignificant findings. Data dredging, p-hacking, and publication bias should be addressed by removing fixed significance thresholds. Consistent with the recommendations of the late Ronald Fisher, p-values should be interpreted as graded measures of the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis. Also larger p-values offer some evidence against the null hypothesis, and they cannot be interpreted as supporting the null hypothesis, falsely concluding that ‘there is no effect’. Information on possible true effect sizes that are compatible with the data must be obtained from the point estimate, e.g., from a sample average, and from the interval estimate, such as a confidence interval. We review how confusion about interpretation of larger p-values can be traced back to historical disputes among the founders of modern statistics. We further discuss potential arguments against removing significance thresholds, for example that decision rules should rather be more stringent, that sample sizes could decrease, or that p-values should better be completely abandoned. We conclude that whatever method of statistical inference we use, dichotomous threshold thinking must give way to non-automated informed judgment.},

We then tested 35 loci (P {\textless} 1 × 10−6) in a replication cohort of 5,851 cases and 5,866 controls. We identified 17 novel risk loci (P {\textless} 5 × 10−8) in a joint analysis of 26,035 cases and 403,190 controls. We used a neurocentric strategy to assign candidate risk genes to the loci. We identified protein-altering or cis–expression quantitative trait locus (cis-eQTL) variants in linkage disequilibrium with the index variant in 29 of the 41 PD loci. These results indicate a key role for autophagy and lysosomal biology in PD risk, and suggest potential new drug targets for PD.},

	abstract = {Using successful genome-wide association results in psychiatry for drug repurposing is an ongoing challenge. Databases collecting drug targets and gene annotations are growing and can be harnessed to shed a new light on psychiatric disorders. We used genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics from the Psychiatric Genetics Consortium (PGC) Schizophrenia working group to build a drug repositioning model for schizophrenia. As sample size increases, schizophrenia GWAS results show increasing enrichment for known antipsychotic drugs, selective calcium channel blockers, and antiepileptics. Each of these therapeutical classes targets different gene subnetworks. We identify 123 Bonferroni-significant druggable genes outside the MHC, and 128 FDR-significant biological pathways related to neurons, synapses, genic intolerance, membrane transport, epilepsy, and mental disorders. These results suggest that, in schizophrenia, current well-powered GWAS results can reliably detect known schizophrenia drugs and thus may hold considerable potential for the identification of new therapeutic leads. Moreover, antiepileptics and calcium channel blockers may provide repurposing opportunities. This study also reveals significant pathways in schizophrenia that were not identified previously, and provides a workflow for pathway analysis and drug repurposing using GWAS results.},

	abstract = {Objective

We have investigated the polygenic architecture of Parkinson disease (PD) and have also explored the potential relationship between an individual's polygenic risk score and their disease age at onset.


Methods

This study used genotypic data from 4,294 cases and 10,340 controls obtained from the meta-analysis of PD genome-wide association studies. Polygenic score analysis was performed as previously described by the International Schizophrenia Consortium, testing whether the polygenic score alleles identified in 1 association study were significantly enriched in the cases relative to the controls of 3 independent studies. Linear regression was used to investigate the relationship between an individual's polygenic score for PD risk alleles and disease age at onset.


Results

Our polygenic score analysis has identified significant evidence for a polygenic component enriched in the cases of each of 3 independent PD genome-wide association cohorts (minimum p = 3.76 × 10−6). Further analysis identified compelling evidence that the average polygenic score in patients with an early disease age at onset was significantly higher than in those with a late age at onset (p = 0.00014).


Interpretation

This provides strong support for a large polygenic contribution to the overall heritable risk of PD and also suggests that early onset forms of the illness are not exclusively caused by highly penetrant Mendelian mutations, but can also be contributed to by an accumulation of common polygenic alleles with relatively low effect sizes.

Yet, given the incompleteness of the interactome and the limited knowledge of disease-associated genes, it is not obvious if the available data have sufficient coverage to map out modules associated with each disease. Here we derive mathematical conditions for the identifiability of disease modules and show that the network-based location of each disease module determines its pathobiological relationship to other diseases. For example, diseases with overlapping network modules show significant coexpression patterns, symptom similarity, and comorbidity, whereas diseases residing in separated network neighborhoods are phenotypically distinct. These tools represent an interactome-based platform to predict molecular commonalities between phenotypically related diseases, even if they do not share primary disease genes.},

These methods can be used when the effects of individual markers is too weak to detect, which is a common problem when studying polygenic traits. Moreover, gene-set analysis can provide additional insight into functional and biological mechanisms underlying the genetic component of a trait. Although a number of methods for gene and gene-set analysis are available however, they generally suffer from various statistical issues and can be very time-consuming to run. We have therefore developed a new method called MAGMA to address these issues, and have compared it to a number of existing tools. Our results show that MAGMA detects more associated genes and gene-sets than other methods, and is also considerably faster. The way the method is set up also makes it highly flexible. This makes it suitable as a basis for more general statistical analyses aimed at investigating more complex research questions.},

This paper shows that these noncoding sequences are functionally connected  at megabase distances  with the homeobox gene \textit{IRX3}. The obesity-associated interval appears to belong to the regulatory functions of \textit{IRX3}, rather than \textit{FTO}. In addition, mice lacking \textit{Irx3} have reduced body weight and are resistant to diet-induced obesity.

The structures of 3,665 FDA-approved and investigational drugs were computationally screened against hundreds of protein targets as defined by the ligands that bind to them. Chemical similarities between the drugs and various sets of ligands predicted thousands of off-target associations, some of which were confirmed in pharmacological assays.

By correcting for the known biases of the interactome, proximity helps us uncover the therapeutic effect of drugs, as well as to distinguish palliative from effective treatments. Our analysis of 238 drugs used in 78 diseases indicates that the therapeutic effect of drugs is localized in a small network neighborhood of the disease genes and highlights efficacy issues for drugs used in Parkinson and several inflammatory disorders. Finally, network-based proximity allows us to predict novel drug-disease associations that offer unprecedented opportunities for drug repurposing and the detection of adverse effects.},

We found that, among well-studied indications, the proportion of drug mechanisms with direct genetic support increases significantly across the drug development pipeline, from 2.0\% at the preclinical stage to 8.2\% among mechanisms for approved drugs, and varies dramatically among disease areas.

Through sequencing or genotyping of {\textasciitilde}150,000 individuals across 5 ancestry groups, we identified 12 rare protein-truncating variants in SLC30A8, which encodes an islet zinc transporter (ZnT8) and harbors a common variant (p.Trp325Arg) associated with T2D risk and glucose and proinsulin levels. Collectively, carriers of protein-truncating variants had 65\% reduced T2D risk (P = 1.7 × 10(-6)), and non-diabetic Icelandic carriers of a frameshift variant (p.Lys34Serfs*50) demonstrated reduced glucose levels (-0.17 s.d., P = 4.6 × 10(-4)). The two most common protein-truncating variants (p.Arg138* and p.Lys34Serfs*50) individually associate with T2D protection and encode unstable ZnT8 proteins. Previous functional study of SLC30A8 suggested that reduced zinc transport increases T2D risk, and phenotypic heterogeneity was observed in mouse Slc30a8 knockouts. In contrast, loss-of-function mutations in humans provide strong evidence that SLC30A8 haploinsufficiency protects against T2D, suggesting ZnT8 inhibition as a therapeutic strategy in T2D prevention.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Guidelines recommend statins as first-line therapy for dyslipidemia. Monoclonal antibodies targeting proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a new lipid-lowering approach.
PURPOSE: To assess the efficacy and safety of PCSK9 antibodies in adults with hypercholesterolemia.
DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, PubMed Central, and Google Scholar; conference proceedings; and the ClinicalTrials.gov registry through 4 April 2015.
STUDY SELECTION: Phase 2 or 3 randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) comparing treatment using PCSK9 antibodies with no anti-PCSK9 therapy in adults with hypercholesterolemia.
DATA EXTRACTION: Two investigators independently extracted data on study characteristics and lipid and clinical outcomes, and rated risk of bias of trials. Prespecified primary end points were all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.
DATA SYNTHESIS: Twenty-four RCTs comprising 10 159 patients were included. Compared with no antibody, treatment with PCSK9 antibodies led to marked reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (mean difference, -47.49\% [95\% CI, -69.64\% to -25.35\%]; P {\textless} 0.001] and other atherogenic lipid fractions, and it reduced all-cause mortality (odds ratio [OR], 0.45 [CI, 0.23 to 0.86]; P = 0.015; heterogeneity P = 0.63; I2 = 0\%) and cardiovascular mortality (OR, 0.50 [CI, 0.23 to 1.10]; P = 0.084; heterogeneity P = 0.78; I2 = 0\%). The rate of myocardial infarction was significantly reduced with use of PCSK9 antibodies (OR, 0.49 [CI, 0.26 to 0.93]; P = 0.030; heterogeneity P = 0.45; I2 = 0\%), and increases in the serum creatine kinase level were reduced (OR, 0.72 [CI, 0.54 to 0.96]; P = 0.026; heterogeneity P = 0.65; I2 = 0\%). Serious adverse events did not increase with administration of PCSK9 antibodies.
LIMITATION: Results were derived from study-level data rather than patient-level data, and clinical outcome data are rare.
CONCLUSION: PCSK9 antibodies seem to be safe and effective for adults with dyslipidemia.

	abstract = {Summary
Inhibition of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 serine protease (PCSK9) resulted in large reductions of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in phase 1 trials. We assessed the efficacy and safety of various doses and dosing intervals of REGN727, a monoclonal antibody to PCSK9, added to statins, to further lower LDL-C in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia. This multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial was done at 16 lipid clinics in the USA and Canada. Between Jan 18, 2011, and Nov 7, 2011, we enrolled adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia and LDL-C concentrations of 2·6 mmol/L or higher on stable diet and statin dose, with or without ezetimibe. Patients were randomly assigned to receive REGN727 150 mg, 200 mg, or 300 mg every 4 weeks, or 150 mg every 2 weeks, or placebo every 2 weeks (ratio 1:1:1:1:1). Randomisation was stratified by concomitant use of ezetimibe at baseline. Investigators, study staff, and patients were masked to treatment group. Blinding was maintained by administration of placebo alternating with REGN727 for the groups of 4 week dosing. The primary endpoint was mean percent reduction in LDL-C from baseline at week 12 and was analysed in the modified intention-to-treat population with an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment group. This trial is registered in ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT 01266876. 77 patients were randomly assigned to study groups (15–16 patients per group) and all were analysed. Least-squares (LS) mean LDL-C reduction from baseline to week 12 was 28·9\% (SE 5·08) for 150 mg every 4 weeks (p=0·0113), 31·54\% (4·91) for 200 mg every 4 weeks (p=0·0035), 42·53\% (5·09) for 300 mg every 4 weeks (p{\textless}0·0001), and 67·90\% (4·85) for 150 mg every 2 weeks (p{\textless}0·0001), compared with 10·65\% (5·04) with placebo. One serious adverse event was reported with placebo and none with REGN727. No increases of more than three times the upper limit of normal were reported for hepatic transaminases or creatinine kinase. The most common adverse event was injection-site reaction with one patient in the group of 300 mg REGN727 terminating treatment. REGN727 was well tolerated and achieved substantial further LDL-C reduction in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia and elevated LDL-C treated with high-dose statins, with or without ezetimibe. REGN727 has the potential to provide optimum control of LDL-C in patients with this disorder. Sanofi US and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Incorporated.},

	abstract = {Summary
Therapeutic treatments for schizophrenia do not alleviate symptoms for all patients and efficacy is limited by common, often severe, side-effects. Genetic studies of disease can identify novel drug targets, and drugs for which the mechanism has direct genetic support have increased likelihood of clinical success. Large-scale genetic studies of schizophrenia have increased the number of genes and gene sets associated with risk. We aimed to examine the overlap between schizophrenia risk loci and gene targets of a comprehensive set of medications to potentially inform and improve treatment of schizophrenia. We defined schizophrenia risk loci as genomic regions reaching genome-wide significance in the latest Psychiatric Genomics Consortium schizophrenia genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 36 989 cases and 113 075 controls and loss of function variants observed only once among 5079 individuals in an exome-sequencing study of 2536 schizophrenia cases and 2543 controls (Swedish Schizophrenia Study). Using two large and orthogonally created databases, we collated drug targets into 167 gene sets targeted by pharmacologically similar drugs and examined enrichment of schizophrenia risk loci in these sets. We further linked the exome-sequenced data with a national drug registry (the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register) to assess the contribution of rare variants to treatment response, using clozapine prescription as a proxy for treatment resistance. We combined results from testing rare and common variation and, after correction for multiple testing, two gene sets were associated with schizophrenia risk: agents against amoebiasis and other protozoal diseases (106 genes, p=0·00046, pcorrected =0·024) and antipsychotics (347 genes, p=0·00078, pcorrected=0·046). Further analysis pointed to antipsychotics as having independent enrichment after removing genes that overlapped these two target sets. We noted significant enrichment both in known targets of antipsychotics (70 genes, p=0·0078) and novel predicted targets (277 genes, p=0·019). Patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia had an excess of rare disruptive variants in gene targets of antipsychotics (347 genes, p=0·0067) and in genes with evidence for a role in antipsychotic efficacy (91 genes, p=0·0029). Our results support genetic overlap between schizophrenia pathogenesis and antipsychotic mechanism of action. This finding is consistent with treatment efficacy being polygenic and suggests that single-target therapeutics might be insufficient. We provide evidence of a role for rare functional variants in antipsychotic treatment response, pointing to a subset of patients where their genetic information could inform treatment. Finally, we present a novel framework for identifying treatments from genetic data and improving our understanding of therapeutic mechanism. US National Institutes of Health.},

	abstract = {Background

We aimed to identify the genetic cause of neurological disease in an Iranian family whose manifestations include symptoms of parkinsonism and cognitive dysfunction.


Methods

Clinical data on the patients were gathered by interviews with parents, neurological examinations, and laboratory tests. Genetic analysis was performed by genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism homozygosity mapping and exome sequencing. The effect of putative disease-causing mutation was assessed by immunocytochemistry on HEK293 cells and Western blotting on proteins extracted from HEK293 cells transfected with wild-type and mutated genes.


Results

Homozygosity mapping and exome sequencing led to identification of a mutation in ADORA1 that causes p.Gly279Ser in the encoded protein, adenosine A1 receptor (A1R), as the probable cause of disease. The mutation segregated with disease status in the family, affects a highly conserved amino acid, and was absent in 700 controls.


Conclusions

The known biological activities of A1R in brain functions including its physical interaction with and inhibitory effect on dopamine receptor D1 provide supportive evidence that disruptions of A1R may result in neurological dysfunction. Also, recent evidence on the related adenosine A2B receptor marks the domain in which the mutation is positioned as important for function. Finally, ADORA1 is located within the Parkinson's disease locus PARK16, which has been identified in several populations. ADORA1 may be the PD susceptibility gene within this locus. The molecular mechanism by which p.Gly279Ser disrupts A1R function remains unknown, but a quantitative effect on interaction with the dopamine receptor was not shown. © 2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society},

Homozygozity mapping and exome sequencing in 62 isolated individuals with early-onset parkinsonism and confirmed consanguinity followed by data mining in the exomes of 1,348 PD-affected individuals identified, in three isolated subjects, homozygous or compound heterozygous truncating mutations in vacuolar protein sorting 13C (VPS13C). VPS13C mutations are associated with a distinct form of early-onset parkinsonism characterized by rapid and severe disease progression and early cognitive decline; the pathological features were striking and reminiscent of diffuse Lewy body disease. In cell models, VPS13C partly localized to the outer membrane of mitochondria. Silencing of VPS13C was associated with lower mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial fragmentation, increased respiration rates, exacerbated PINK1/Parkin-dependent mitophagy, and transcriptional upregulation of PARK2 in response to mitochondrial damage. This work suggests that loss of function of VPS13C is a cause of autosomal-recessive early-onset parkinsonism with a distinctive phenotype of rapid and severe progression.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Parkinson disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease for which susceptibility is linked to genetic and environmental risk factors.
OBJECTIVE: To identify genetic variants contributing to disease risk in familial PD.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A 2-stage study design that included a discovery cohort of families with PD and a replication cohort of familial probands was used. In the discovery cohort, rare exonic variants that segregated in multiple affected individuals in a family and were predicted to be conserved or damaging were retained. Genes with retained variants were prioritized if expressed in the brain and located within PD-relevant pathways. Genes in which prioritized variants were observed in at least 4 families were selected as candidate genes for replication in the replication cohort. The setting was among individuals with familial PD enrolled from academic movement disorder specialty clinics across the United States. All participants had a family history of PD.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Identification of genes containing rare, likely deleterious, genetic variants in individuals with familial PD using a 2-stage exome sequencing study design.
RESULTS: The 93 individuals from 32 families in the discovery cohort (49.5\% [46 of 93] female) had a mean (SD) age at onset of 61.8 (10.0) years. The 49 individuals with familial PD in the replication cohort (32.6\% [16 of 49] female) had a mean (SD) age at onset of 50.1 (15.7) years. Discovery cohort recruitment dates were 1999 to 2009, and replication cohort recruitment dates were 2003 to 2014. Data analysis dates were 2011 to 2015. Three genes containing a total of 13 rare and potentially damaging variants were prioritized in the discovery cohort. Two of these genes (TNK2 and TNR) also had rare variants that were predicted to be damaging in the replication cohort. All 9 variants identified in the 2 replicated genes in 12 families across the discovery and replication cohorts were confirmed via Sanger sequencing.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: TNK2 and TNR harbored rare, likely deleterious, variants in individuals having familial PD, with similar findings in an independent cohort. To our knowledge, these genes have not been previously associated with PD, although they have been linked to critical neuronal functions. Further studies are required to confirm a potential role for these genes in the pathogenesis of PD.},

DNAJC6 mutations were recently described in two families with autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism (onset age {\textless} 11), prominent atypical signs, poor or absent response to levodopa, and rapid progression (wheelchair-bound within ∼10 years from onset). Here, for the first time, we report DNAJC6 mutations in early-onset Parkinson's disease (PD).


Methods

The DNAJC6 open reading frame was analyzed in 274 patients with early-onset sporadic or familial PD. Selected variants were followed up by cosegregation, homozygosity mapping, linkage analysis, whole-exome sequencing, and protein studies.


Results

We identified two families with different novel homozygous DNAJC6 mutations segregating with PD. In each family, the DNAJC6 mutation was flanked by long runs of homozygosity within highest linkage peaks. Exome sequencing did not detect additional pathogenic variants within the linkage regions. In both families, patients showed severely decreased steady-state levels of the auxilin protein in fibroblasts. We also identified a sporadic patient carrying two rare noncoding DNAJC6 variants possibly effecting RNA splicing. All these cases fulfilled the criteria for a clinical diagnosis of early-onset PD, had symptoms onset in the third-to-fifth decade, and slow disease progression. Response to dopaminergic therapies was prominent, but, in some patients, limited by psychiatric side effects. The phenotype overlaps that of other monogenic forms of early-onset PD.


Interpretation

Our findings delineate a novel form of hereditary early-onset PD. Screening of DNAJC6 is warranted in all patients with early-onset PD compatible with autosomal recessive inheritance. Our data provide further evidence for the involvement of synaptic vesicles endocytosis and trafficking in PD pathogenesis. Ann Neurol 2016;79:244–256},

Whereas a sequential p-value method fixes the error rate and estimates its corresponding rejection region, we propose the opposite approach-we fix the rejection region and then estimate its corresponding error rate. This new approach offers increased applicability, accuracy and power. We apply the methodology to both the positive false discovery rate pFDR and FDR, and provide evidence for its benefits. It is shown that pFDR is probably the quantity of interest over FDR. Also discussed is the calculation of the q-value, the pFDR analogue of the p-value, which eliminates the need to set the error rate beforehand as is traditionally done. Some simple numerical examples are presented that show that this new approach can yield an increase of over eight times in power compared with the Benjamini-Hochberg FDR method.},

One of the central goals in any scientific endeavor is to understand causality. Experiments that seek to demonstrate a cause/effect relation most often manipulate the postulated causal factor. Aarts et al. describe the replication of 100 experiments reported in papers published in 2008 in three high-ranking psychology journals. Assessing whether the replication and the original experiment yielded the same result according to several criteria, they find that about one-third to one-half of the original findings were also observed in the replication study.
Science, this issue 10.1126/science.aac4716
Structured Abstract
INTRODUCTIONReproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown. Scientific claims should not gain credence because of the status or authority of their originator but by the replicability of their supporting evidence. Even research of exemplary quality may have irreproducible empirical findings because of random or systematic error.
RATIONALEThere is concern about the rate and predictors of reproducibility, but limited evidence. Potentially problematic practices include selective reporting, selective analysis, and insufficient specification of the conditions necessary or sufficient to obtain the results. Direct replication is the attempt to recreate the conditions believed sufficient for obtaining a previously observed finding and is the means of establishing reproducibility of a finding with new data. We conducted a large-scale, collaborative effort to obtain an initial estimate of the reproducibility of psychological science.
RESULTSWe conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. There is no single standard for evaluating replication success. Here, we evaluated reproducibility using significance and P values, effect sizes, subjective assessments of replication teams, and meta-analysis of effect sizes. The mean effect size (r) of the replication effects (Mr = 0.197, SD = 0.257) was half the magnitude of the mean effect size of the original effects (Mr = 0.403, SD = 0.188), representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had significant results (P {\textless} .05). Thirty-six percent of replications had significant results; 47\% of original effect sizes were in the 95\% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39\% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68\% with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams.
CONCLUSIONNo single indicator sufficiently describes replication success, and the five indicators examined here are not the only ways to evaluate reproducibility. Nonetheless, collectively these results offer a clear conclusion: A large portion of replications produced weaker evidence for the original findings despite using materials provided by the original authors, review in advance for methodological fidelity, and high statistical power to detect the original effect sizes. Moreover, correlational evidence is consistent with the conclusion that variation in the strength of initial evidence (such as original P value) was more predictive of replication success than variation in the characteristics of the teams conducting the research (such as experience and expertise). The latter factors certainly can influence replication success, but they did not appear to do so here.Reproducibility is not well understood because the incentives for individual scientists prioritize novelty over replication. Innovation is the engine of discovery and is vital for a productive, effective scientific enterprise. However, innovative ideas become old news fast. Journal reviewers and editors may dismiss a new test of a published idea as unoriginal. The claim that “we already know this” belies the uncertainty of scientific evidence. Innovation points out paths that are possible; replication points out paths that are likely; progress relies on both. Replication can increase certainty when findings are reproduced and promote innovation when they are not. This project provides accumulating evidence for many findings in psychological research and suggests that there is still more work to do to verify whether we know what we think we know. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" src="https://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/content/sci/349/6251/aac4716/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Original study effect size versus replication effect size (correlation coefficients).Diagonal line represents replication effect size equal to original effect size.

Reproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown. We conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. Replication effects were half the magnitude of original effects, representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had statistically significant results.

A large-scale assessment suggests that experimental reproducibility in psychology leaves a lot to be desired.

	abstract = {SummaryThe effect of the synthetic retinoid acitretin (A) on the disposition of blood glucose and on the serum insulin response following the IV infusion of 139 mmol glucose over 10 min (IGTT) has been investigated in six healthy subjects. The IGTT was performed on Days 1, 10 and 24. On Days 3 to 10 A 50 mg/d was administered. Several parameters of glucose disposition and insulin response (K-values, AUC) were assessed. As a methodological variant, the profiles over time of blood glucose and serum insulin were evaluated by model calculations using the ‘minimal model’. Acitretin did not influence any parameter of glucose disposition. The area under the insulin-time curve (baseline corrected) was significantly decreased from 1.20 mU·min·l−1 on Day 1 to 0.89 mU·min·l−1 on Day 10, and was 0.91 mU·min·l−1 on Day 24. The model-derived ‘insulin sensitivity’ increased from 13·10−4 l·mU−1·min−1 on Day 1 to 20·10−4 l·mU−1·min−1 on Day 10 and was 18·10−4 l·mU−1·min−1 on Day 24. The results suggest that A increased sensitivity to endogenous insulin. It supports a recent report showing greater insulin sensitivity in patients treated with the synthetic retinoid etretinate.},

Clinicians often wonder what effect it has on blood pressure and whether they are safe in hypertensive patients. The purpose of our systematic review was to assess whether these drugs cause clinically meaningful elevations in pulse or blood pressure. English-language, randomized, placebo-controlled trials of oral phenylpropanolamine in adults with extractable data on pulse or blood pressure were studied. MEDLINE (1966-2003), Embase, the Cochrane library and reviewed article references were used as sources. Systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate data were extracted. Additional extracted data included demographics, year, study design, study duration, drug dose and frequency, duration of washout and country. Study quality was assessed using the methods of Jadad and data were synthesized using a random effects model using weighted mean differences. In all, 33 trials reporting 48 treatment arms with 2165 patients were included. Phenylpropanolamine increased SBP 5.5 mmHg (95\% CI: 3.1-8.0) and DBP 4.1 mmHg (95\% CI: 2.2-6.0) with no effect on pulse. Patients with controlled hypertension were not at greater risk of blood pressure elevation. Immediate release preparations had greater effects on blood pressure than sustained release ones. Higher doses and shorter duration use also caused greater increases. Eighteen studies contained at least one treated subjects having blood pressure elevations {\textgreater} or =140/90 mmHg, an increase in SBP {\textgreater} or =15 mmHg or an increase in DBP {\textgreater} or =10 mmHg. In conclusion, phenylpropanolamine caused a small, but significant increase in systolic blood pressure. The effect was more pronounced with shorter-term administration, higher doses of medication and immediate release formulations.},

	abstract = {Background Helicobacter pylori, a lifelong and typically asymptomatic infection of the stomach, profoundly alters gastric immune responses, and may benefit the host in protection against other pathogens. We explored the hypothesis that H. pylori contributes to the control of infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis.  Methodology/Principal Findings We first examined M. tuberculosis-specific IFN-γ and H. pylori antibody responses in 339 healthy Northern Californians undergoing routine tuberculin skin testing. Of 97 subjects (29\%) meeting criteria for latent tuberculosis (TB) infection (LTBI), 45 (46\%) were H. pylori seropositive. Subjects with LTBI who were H. pylori-seropositive had 1.5-fold higher TB antigen-induced IFN-γ responses (p = 0.04, ANOVA), and a more Th-1 like cytokine profile in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, compared to those who were H. pylori seronegative. To explore an association between H. pylori infection and clinical outcome of TB exposure, we evaluated H. pylori seroprevalence in baseline samples from two high risk TB case-contact cohorts, and from cynomolgus macaques experimentally challenged with M. tuberculosis. Compared to 513 household contacts who did not progress to active disease during a median 24 months follow-up, 120 prevalent TB cases were significantly less likely to be H. pylori infected (AOR: 0.55, 95\% CI 0.0.36–0.83, p = 0.005), though seroprevalence was not significantly different from non-progressors in 37 incident TB cases (AOR: 1.35 [95\% CI 0.63–2.9] p = 0.44). Cynomolgus macaques with natural H. pylori infection were significantly less likely to progress to TB 6 to 8 months after M. tuberculosis challenge (RR: 0.31 [95\% CI 0.12–0.80], p = 0.04).  Conclusions/Significance H. pylori infection may induce bystander effects that modify the risk of active TB in humans and non-human primates. That immunity to TB may be enhanced by exposure to other microbial agents may have important implications for vaccine development and disease control.},

	abstract = {Pathway analysis is a powerful method for data analysis in genomics, most often applied to gene expression analysis. It is also promising for single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data analysis, such as genome-wide association study data, because it allows the interpretation of variants with respect to the biological processes in which the affected genes and proteins are involved. Such analyses support an interactive evaluation of the possible effects of variations on function, regulation or interaction of gene products. Current pathway analysis software often does not support data visualization of variants in pathways as an alternate method to interpret genetic association results, and specific statistical methods for pathway analysis of SNP data are not combined with these visualization features. In this review, we first describe the visualization options of the tools that were identified by a literature review, in order to provide insight for improvements in this developing field. Tool evaluation was performed using a computational epistatic dataset of gene–gene interactions for obesity risk. Next, we report the necessity to include in these tools statistical methods designed for the pathway-based analysis with SNP data, expressly aiming to define features for more comprehensive pathway-based analysis tools. We conclude by recognizing that pathway analysis of genetic variations data requires a sophisticated combination of the most useful and informative visual aspects of the various tools evaluated.},

	abstract = {Background: Genomic copy number variants (CNVs) increase risk for early-onset neurodevelopmental disorders but their impact on medical outcomes in later life is poorly understood. The UK Biobank, with half a million well-phenotyped adults, presents an opportunity to study the medical consequences of CNV in middle and old age. Methods: We called 54 CNVs associated with clinical phenotypes or genomic disorders, including their reciprocal deletions or duplications, in all Biobank participants. We used logistic regression analysis to test CNVs for associations with 58 common medical phenotypes. Findings: CNV carriers had an increased risk of developing 37 of the 58 phenotypes at nominal levels of statistical significance, with 19 associations surviving Bonferroni correction (p{\textless}8.6x10-4). Tests of each of the 54 CNVs for association with each of the 58 phenotypes identified 18 associations that survived Bonferroni correction (p{\textless}1.6x10-5) and a further 57 that were associated at a false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of 0.1. Thirteen CNVs had three or more significant associations at FDR=0.1, with the largest number of phenotypes (N=15) found for deletions at 16p11.2. The most common CNVs (frequency 0.5-0.7\%) have no or minimal impact on medical outcomes in adults. Interpretation: Some of the 54 tested CNVs have profound effects on physical health, even in people who have largely escaped early neurodevelopmental outcomes. Our work provides clinicians with a morbidity map of potential outcomes among carriers of these CNVs.},

Two genes, SETD1A and RBM12, have also been associated with robust statistical evidence. Larger samples and novel methods for identifying disease-associated missense variants are needed to reveal novel genes and biological mechanisms associated with schizophrenia. We sequenced 187 genes, selected for prior evidence of association with schizophrenia, in a new dataset of 5,207 cases and 4,991 controls. Included were members of ARC and NMDAR post-synaptic protein complexes, as well as voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels. We observed a significant case excess of rare ({\textless}0.1\% in frequency) loss-of-function (LoF) mutations across all 187 genes (OR = 1.36; Pcorrected = 0.0072) but no individual gene was associated with schizophrenia after correcting for multiple testing. We found novel evidence that LoF and missense variants at paralog conserved sites were enriched in sodium channels (OR = 1.26; P = 0.0035). Meta-analysis of our new data with published sequencing data (11,319 cases, 15,854 controls and 1,136 trios) supported and refined this association to sodium channel alpha subunits (P = 0.0029). Meta-analysis also confirmed association between schizophrenia and rare variants in ARC (P = 4.0 x 10-4) and NMDAR (P = 1.7 x 10-5) synaptic genes. No association was found between rare variants in calcium channels and schizophrenia. In one of the largest sequencing studies of schizophrenia to date, we provide novel evidence that multiple voltage-gated sodium channels are involved in schizophrenia pathogenesis, and increase the evidence for association between rare variants in ARC and NMDAR post-synaptic complexes and schizophrenia. Larger samples are required to identify specific genes and variants driving these associations.},

	abstract = {Traditional drug development for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is costly, time consuming and burdened by a very low success rate. An alternative strategy is drug repositioning, redirecting existing drugs for another disease. The large amount of biological data accumulated to date warrants a comprehensive investigation to better understand AD pathogenesis and facilitate the process of anti-AD drug repositioning. Hence, we generated a list of anti-AD protein targets by analyzing the most recent publically available ‘omics’ data, including genomics, epigenomics, proteomics and metabolomics data. The information related to AD pathogenesis was obtained from the OMIM and PubMed databases. Drug-target data was extracted from the DrugBank and Therapeutic Target Database. We generated a list of 524 AD-related proteins, 18 of which are targets for 75 existing drugs—novel candidates for repurposing as anti-AD treatments. We developed a ranking algorithm to prioritize the anti-AD targets, which revealed CD33 and MIF as the strongest candidates with seven existing drugs. We also found 7 drugs inhibiting a known anti-AD target (acetylcholinesterase) that may be repurposed for treating the cognitive symptoms of AD. The CAD protein and 8 proteins implicated by two ‘omics’ approaches (ABCA7, APOE, BIN1, PICALM, CELF1, INPP5D, SPON1, and SOD3) might also be promising targets for anti-AD drug development. Our systematic ‘omics’ mining suggested drugs with novel anti-AD indications, including drugs modulating the immune system or reducing neuroinflammation that are particularly promising for AD intervention. Furthermore, the list of 524 AD-related proteins could be useful not only as potential anti-AD targets but also considered for AD biomarker development.},

	abstract = {Drug repositioning has shorter developmental time, lower cost and less safety risk than traditional drug development process. The current study aims to repurpose marketed drugs and clinical candidates for new indications in diabetes treatment by mining clinical 'omics' data. We analyzed data from genome wide association studies (GWAS), proteomics and metabolomics studies and revealed a total of 992 proteins as potential anti-diabetic targets in human. Information on the drugs that target these 992 proteins was retrieved from the Therapeutic Target Database (TTD) and 108 of these proteins are drug targets with drug projects information. Research and preclinical drug targets were excluded and 35 of the 108 proteins were selected as druggable proteins. Among them, five proteins were known targets for treating diabetes. Based on the pathogenesis knowledge gathered from the OMIM and PubMed databases, 12 protein targets of 58 drugs were found to have a new indication for treating diabetes. CMap (connectivity map) was used to compare the gene expression patterns of cells treated by these 58 drugs and that of cells treated by known anti-diabetic drugs or diabetes risk causing compounds. As a result, 9 drugs were found to have the potential to treat diabetes. Among the 9 drugs, 4 drugs (diflunisal, nabumetone, niflumic acid and valdecoxib) targeting COX2 (prostaglandin G/H synthase 2) were repurposed for treating type 1 diabetes, and 2 drugs (phenoxybenzamine and idazoxan) targeting ADRA2A (Alpha-2A adrenergic receptor) had a new indication for treating type 2 diabetes. These findings indicated that 'omics' data mining based drug repositioning is a potentially powerful tool to discover novel anti-diabetic indications from marketed drugs and clinical candidates. Furthermore, the results of our study could be related to other disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease.},

Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase inhibitors (relative risk = 0.64; 95\% confidence interval 0.51–0.79) and corticosteroids (relative risk = 0.80; 95\% confidence interval 0.77–0.83) were both associated with a lower risk of Parkinson disease.

	abstract = {Drug-target interaction (DTI) is the basis of drug discovery and design. It is time consuming and costly to determine DTI experimentally. Hence, it is necessary to develop computational methods for the prediction of potential DTI. Based on complex network theory, three supervised inference methods were developed here to predict DTI and used for drug repositioning, namely drug-based similarity inference (DBSI), target-based similarity inference (TBSI) and network-based inference (NBI). Among them, NBI performed best on four benchmark data sets. Then a drug-target network was created with NBI based on 12,483 FDA-approved and experimental drug-target binary links, and some new DTIs were further predicted. In vitro assays confirmed that five old drugs, namely montelukast, diclofenac, simvastatin, ketoconazole, and itraconazole, showed polypharmacological features on estrogen receptors or dipeptidyl peptidase-IV with half maximal inhibitory or effective concentration ranged from 0.2 to 10 µM. Moreover, simvastatin and ketoconazole showed potent antiproliferative activities on human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line in MTT assays. The results indicated that these methods could be powerful tools in prediction of DTIs and drug repositioning.},

For a set of query compounds, how can we identify which ATC-class (or classes) they belong to? It is an important and challenging problem because the information thus obtained would be quite useful for drug development and utilization. By hybridizing the informations of chemical-chemical interactions and chemical-chemical similarities, a novel method was developed for such purpose. It was observed by the jackknife test on a benchmark dataset of 3,883 drug compounds that the overall success rate achieved by the prediction method was about 73\% in identifying the drugs among the following 14 main ATC-classes: (1) alimentary tract and metabolism; (2) blood and blood forming organs; (3) cardiovascular system; (4) dermatologicals; (5) genitourinary system and sex hormones; (6) systemic hormonal preparations, excluding sex hormones and insulins; (7) anti-infectives for systemic use; (8) antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents; (9) musculoskeletal system; (10) nervous system; (11) antiparasitic products, insecticides and repellents; (12) respiratory system; (13) sensory organs; (14) various. Such a success rate is substantially higher than 7\% by the random guess. It has not escaped our notice that the current method can be straightforwardly extended to identify the drugs for their 2nd-level, 3rd-level, 4th-level, and 5th-level ATC-classifications once the statistically significant benchmark data are available for these lower levels.},

We built easily interpretable bipartite drug-target networks integrating interactions between drugs and their targets, genome-wide association statistics and genetically predicted expression levels in different tissues, using our online tool Drug Targetor (drugtargetor.com). We also investigated drug-target relationships and drug effects on gene expression that could be impacting MDD. MAGMA was used to perform pathway analyses and S-PrediXcan to investigate the directionality of tissue-specific expression levels in patients vs. controls. Outside the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region, 25 druggable genes were significantly associated with MDD after multiple testing correction, and 19 were suggestively significant. Several drug classes were significantly enriched, including monoamine reuptake inhibitors, sex hormones, antipsychotics and antihistamines, indicating an effect on MDD and potential repurposing opportunities. These findings require validation in model systems and clinical examination, but also show that GWAS may become a rich source of new therapeutic hypotheses for MDD and other psychiatric disorders that need new - and better - treatment options.},

TWAS exhibit acute instability when the tissue of the expression panel is changed: candidate causal genes that are TWAS hits in one tissue are usually no longer hits in another, due to lack of expression or strong eQTLs, while non-causal genes at the same loci remain. While TWAS is statistically valid when used as a weighted burden test to identify trait-associated loci, it is invalid to interpret TWAS associations as causal genes because the false discovery rate for TWAS causal gene discovery is not only high, but unquantifiable.

But in practice, there are fundamental, technical, and social barriers to doing so. The many objectives and meanings of reproducibility are discussed within the context of scientific computing. Technical barriers to reproducibility are described, extant approaches surveyed, and open areas of research are identified.},

	abstract = {Background In psychiatric genetics research, the volume of ambivalent findings on gene-environment interactions (G x E) is growing at an accelerating pace. In response to the surging suspicions of systematic distortion, we challenge the notion of chance capitalization as a possible contributor. Beyond qualifying multiple testing as a mere methodological issue that, if uncorrected, leads to chance capitalization, we advance towards illustrating the potential benefits of multiple tests in understanding equivocal evidence in genetics literature. Method We focused on the interaction between the serotonin-transporter-linked promotor region (5-HTTLPR) and childhood adversities with regard to depression. After testing 2160 interactions with all relevant measures available within the Dutch population study of adolescents TRAILS, we calculated percentages of significant (p {\textless} .05) effects for several subsets of regressions. Using chance capitalization (i.e. overall significance rate of 5\% alpha and randomly distributed findings) as a competing hypothesis, we expected more significant effects in the subsets of regressions involving: 1) interview-based instead of questionnaire-based measures; 2) abuse instead of milder childhood adversities; and 3) early instead of later adversities. Furthermore, we expected equal significance percentages across 4) male and female subsamples, and 5) various genotypic models of 5-HTTLPR. Results We found differences in the percentages of significant interactions among the subsets of analyses, including those regarding sex-specific subsamples and genetic modeling, but often in unexpected directions. Overall, the percentage of significant interactions was 7.9\% which is only slightly above the 5\% that might be expected based on chance. Conclusion Taken together, multiple testing provides a novel approach to better understand equivocal evidence on G x E, showing that methodological differences across studies are a likely reason for heterogeneity in findings - but chance capitalization is at least equally plausible.},

Exons, and especially splice sites, have higher levels of DNA methylation than flanking introns, and the splicing of about 22\% of alternative exons is regulated by DNA methylation. Two different mechanisms convey DNA methylation information into the regulation of alternative splicing. The first involves modulation of the elongation rate of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) by CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2); the second involves the formation of a protein bridge by heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) that recruits splicing factors onto transcribed alternative exons.

Misfolded α-synuclein is a pathological hallmark of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Killinger et al. now report that the human appendix contains an abundance of misfolded α-synuclein and that removal of the appendix decreased the risk of developing PD. The appendix of both PD cases and healthy individuals contained abnormally cleaved and aggregated forms of α-synuclein, analogous to those found in postmortem brain tissue from patients with PD. Furthermore, α-synuclein derived from the appendix seeded rapid aggregation of recombinant α-synuclein in vitro. In two large-scale epidemiological studies, the authors demonstrated that an appendectomy occurring decades prior reduced the risk of developing PD, suggesting that the appendix may be implicated in PD initiation.
The pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD) involves the accumulation of aggregated α-synuclein, which has been suggested to begin in the gastrointestinal tract. Here, we determined the capacity of the appendix to modify PD risk and influence pathogenesis. In two independent epidemiological datasets, involving more than 1.6 million individuals and over 91 million person-years, we observed that removal of the appendix decades before PD onset was associated with a lower risk for PD, particularly for individuals living in rural areas, and delayed the age of PD onset. We also found that the healthy human appendix contained intraneuronal α-synuclein aggregates and an abundance of PD pathology–associated α-synuclein truncation products that are known to accumulate in Lewy bodies, the pathological hallmark of PD. Lysates of human appendix tissue induced the rapid cleavage and oligomerization of full-length recombinant α-synuclein. Together, we propose that the normal human appendix contains pathogenic forms of α-synuclein that affect the risk of developing PD.
The human appendix is a reservoir for α-synuclein aggregates and its removal may reduce the risk of Parkinson’s disease.

Current PD medications treat symptoms; none halt or retard dopaminergic neuron degeneration. The main obstacle to developing neuroprotective therapies is a limited understanding of the key molecular events that provoke neurodegeneration. The discovery of PD genes has led to the hypothesis that misfolding of proteins and dysfunction of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway are pivotal to PD pathogenesis. Previously implicated culprits in PD neurodegeneration, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, may also act in part by causing the accumulation of misfolded proteins, in addition to producing other deleterious events in dopaminergic neurons. Neurotoxin-based models (particularly MPTP) have been important in elucidating the molecular cascade of cell death in dopaminergic neurons. PD models based on the manipulation of PD genes should prove valuable in elucidating important aspects of the disease, such as selective vulnerability of substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons to the degenerative process.},

In its extended form, it encodes more than 400 genes critical to immunity but is also involved in many other functions. In 2009, three simultaneously published genome-wide association studies (GWAS) reported the first compelling evidence for involvement of the MHC in schizophrenia susceptibility. In this review, we describe the structure and function of the MHC, discuss some of the challenges for genetic analysis of the region, and provide an update on findings from GWAS studies before describing potential approaches to interpreting the role of the locus in schizophrenia etiology. The GWAS literature supports involvement of the MHC locus in schizophrenia susceptibility. Current evidence suggests that the MHC plays a more significant role in schizophrenia susceptibility than in other psychiatric disorders. Because of the substantial diversity at the locus, there are differences in the implicated risk variants between ancestral groups, as there are for many other disorders. This is somewhat different than the pattern emerging at other loci. The association findings presently capture large genomic regions, with at least some evidence to suggest that multiple signals may be involved. Based on notable successes in other disorders, we suggest approaches to refining association signals at the locus. Finally, we discuss that these genetic data may be used to understand how the MHC contributes to the complex etiology of schizophrenia.},

As such, it is extensively used by the biomedical research community for the analysis of -omics and related data. Our continued focus is on improving the quality and utility of the GO resources, and we welcome and encourage input from researchers in all areas of biology. In this update, we summarize the current contents of the GO knowledgebase, and present several new features and improvements that have been made to the ontology, the annotations and the tools. Among the highlights are 1) developments that facilitate access to, and application of, the GO knowledgebase, and 2) extensions to the resource as well as increasing support for descriptions of causal models of biological systems and network biology.

Although methods for gene-set analyses (GSA), also called pathway analyses, have been around for more than a decade, the field is still evolving. There are numerous algorithms available for testing the cumulative effect of multiple SNPs, yet no real consensus in the field about the best way to perform a GSA. This paper provides an overview of the factors that can affect the results of a GSA, the lessons learned from past studies, and suggestions for how to make analysis choices that are most appropriate for different types of data.},

	abstract = {Determining the full complement of protein-coding genes is a key goal of genome annotation. The most powerful approach for confirming protein-coding potential is the detection of cellular protein expression through peptide mass spectrometry (MS) experiments. Here, we mapped peptides detected in seven large-scale proteomics studies to almost 60\% of the protein-coding genes in the GENCODE annotation of the human genome. We found a strong relationship between detection in proteomics experiments and both gene family age and cross-species conservation. Most of the genes for which we detected peptides were highly conserved. We found peptides for {\textgreater}96\% of genes that evolved before bilateria. At the opposite end of the scale, we identified almost no peptides for genes that have appeared since primates, for genes that did not have any protein-like features or for genes with poor cross-species conservation. These results motivated us to describe a set of 2001 potential non-coding genes based on features such as weak conservation, a lack of protein features, or ambiguous annotations from major databases, all of which correlated with low peptide detection across the seven experiments. We identified peptides for just 3\% of these genes. We show that many of these genes behave more like non-coding genes than protein-coding genes and suggest that most are unlikely to code for proteins under normal circumstances. We believe that their inclusion in the human protein-coding gene catalogue should be revised as part of the ongoing human genome annotation effort.},
