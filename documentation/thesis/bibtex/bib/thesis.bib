	abstract = {Author Summary Gene and gene-set analysis are statistical methods for analysing multiple genetic markers simultaneously to determine their joint effect. These methods can be used when the effects of individual markers is too weak to detect, which is a common problem when studying polygenic traits. Moreover, gene-set analysis can provide additional insight into functional and biological mechanisms underlying the genetic component of a trait. Although a number of methods for gene and gene-set analysis are available however, they generally suffer from various statistical issues and can be very time-consuming to run. We have therefore developed a new method called MAGMA to address these issues, and have compared it to a number of existing tools. Our results show that MAGMA detects more associated genes and gene-sets than other methods, and is also considerably faster. The way the method is set up also makes it highly flexible. This makes it suitable as a basis for more general statistical analyses aimed at investigating more complex research questions.},

Although the biological actions of \textit{FTO} have been intensely scrutinized, it is still not clear how these genetic variants influence FTO expression and biology. This paper shows that these noncoding sequences are functionally connected  at megabase distances  with the homeobox gene \textit{IRX3}. The obesity-associated interval appears to belong to the regulatory functions of \textit{IRX3}, rather than \textit{FTO}. In addition, mice lacking \textit{Irx3} have reduced body weight and are resistant to diet-induced obesity. Taken together, the data suggest that \textit{IRX3} is an important metabolic regulator associated with human obesity and type 2 diabetes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Previous versions of DrugBank have been widely used to facilitate drug and in silico drug target discovery. The latest update, DrugBank 4.0, has been further expanded to contain data on drug metabolism, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) and other kinds of quantitative structure activity relationships (QSAR) information. These enhancements are intended to facilitate research in xenobiotic metabolism (both prediction and characterization), pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and drug design/discovery. For this release, \&gt;1200 drug metabolites (including their structures, names, activity, abundance and other detailed data) have been added along with \&gt;1300 drug metabolism reactions (including metabolizing enzymes and reaction types) and dozens of drug metabolism pathways. Another 30 predicted or measured ADMET parameters have been added to each DrugCard, bringing the average number of quantitative ADMET values for Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs close to 40. Referential nuclear magnetic resonance and MS spectra have been added for almost 400 drugs as well as spectral and mass matching tools to facilitate compound identification.

Our analysis of 238 drugs used in 78 diseases indicates that the therapeutic effect of drugs is localized in a small network neighborhood of the disease genes and highlights efficacy issues for drugs used in Parkinson and several inflammatory disorders.

Growing insight into genes that influence human disease may affect how drug targets and indications are selected. However, there is little guidance about how much weight should be given to genetic evidence in making these key decisions. To answer this question, we investigated how well the current archive of genetic evidence predicts drug mechanisms. We found that, among well-studied indications, the proportion of drug mechanisms with direct genetic support increases significantly across the drug development pipeline, from 2.0\% at the preclinical stage to 8.2\% among mechanisms for approved drugs, and varies dramatically among disease areas. We estimate that selecting genetically supported targets could double the success rate in clinical development. Therefore, using the growing wealth of human genetic data to select the best targets and indications should have a measurable impact on the successful development of new drugs.},

	abstract = {Summary
Therapeutic treatments for schizophrenia do not alleviate symptoms for all patients and efficacy is limited by common, often severe, side-effects. Genetic studies of disease can identify novel drug targets, and drugs for which the mechanism has direct genetic support have increased likelihood of clinical success. Large-scale genetic studies of schizophrenia have increased the number of genes and gene sets associated with risk. We aimed to examine the overlap between schizophrenia risk loci and gene targets of a comprehensive set of medications to potentially inform and improve treatment of schizophrenia. We defined schizophrenia risk loci as genomic regions reaching genome-wide significance in the latest Psychiatric Genomics Consortium schizophrenia genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 36 989 cases and 113 075 controls and loss of function variants observed only once among 5079 individuals in an exome-sequencing study of 2536 schizophrenia cases and 2543 controls (Swedish Schizophrenia Study). Using two large and orthogonally created databases, we collated drug targets into 167 gene sets targeted by pharmacologically similar drugs and examined enrichment of schizophrenia risk loci in these sets. We further linked the exome-sequenced data with a national drug registry (the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register) to assess the contribution of rare variants to treatment response, using clozapine prescription as a proxy for treatment resistance. We combined results from testing rare and common variation and, after correction for multiple testing, two gene sets were associated with schizophrenia risk: agents against amoebiasis and other protozoal diseases (106 genes, p=0·00046, pcorrected =0·024) and antipsychotics (347 genes, p=0·00078, pcorrected=0·046). Further analysis pointed to antipsychotics as having independent enrichment after removing genes that overlapped these two target sets. We noted significant enrichment both in known targets of antipsychotics (70 genes, p=0·0078) and novel predicted targets (277 genes, p=0·019). Patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia had an excess of rare disruptive variants in gene targets of antipsychotics (347 genes, p=0·0067) and in genes with evidence for a role in antipsychotic efficacy (91 genes, p=0·0029). Our results support genetic overlap between schizophrenia pathogenesis and antipsychotic mechanism of action. This finding is consistent with treatment efficacy being polygenic and suggests that single-target therapeutics might be insufficient. We provide evidence of a role for rare functional variants in antipsychotic treatment response, pointing to a subset of patients where their genetic information could inform treatment. Finally, we present a novel framework for identifying treatments from genetic data and improving our understanding of therapeutic mechanism. US National Institutes of Health.},

Although high-throughput screening and other biological assays are becoming available, experimental methods for drug-target interaction identification remain to be extremely costly, time-consuming and challenging even nowadays. Therefore, various computational models have been developed to predict potential drug-target associations on a large scale. In this review, databases and web servers involved in drug-target identification and drug discovery are summarized. In addition, we mainly introduced some state-of-the-art computational models for drug-target interactions prediction, including network-based method, machine learning-based method and so on. Specially, for the machine learning-based method, much attention was paid to supervised and semi-supervised models, which have essential difference in the adoption of negative samples. Although significant improvements for drug-target interaction prediction have been obtained by many effective computational models, both network-based and machine learning-based methods have their disadvantages, respectively. Furthermore, we discuss the future directions of the network-based drug discovery and network approach for personalized drug discovery based on personalized medicine, genome sequencing, tumor clone-based network and cancer hallmark-based network. Finally, we discussed the new evaluation validation framework and the formulation of drug-target interactions prediction problem by more realistic regression formulation based on quantitative bioactivity data.},

	abstract = {The prediction of drug-target interactions (DTIs) is of extraordinary significance to modern drug discovery in terms of suggesting new drug candidates and repositioning old drugs. Despite technological advances, large-scale experimental determination of DTIs is still expensive and laborious. Effective and low-cost computational alternatives remain in strong need. Meanwhile, open-access resources have been rapidly growing with massive amount of bioactivity data becoming available, creating unprecedented opportunities for the development of novel in silico models for large-scale DTI prediction. In this work, we review the state-of-the-art computational approaches for identifying DTIs from a data-centric perspective: what the underlying data are and how they are utilized in each study. We also summarize popular public data resources and online tools for DTI prediction. It is found that various types of data were employed including properties of chemical structures, drug therapeutic effects and side effects, drug-target binding, drug-drug interactions, bioactivity data of drug molecules across multiple biological targets, and drug-induced gene expressions. More often, the heterogeneous data were integrated to offer better performance. However, challenges remain such as handling data imbalance, incorporating negative samples and quantitative bioactivity data, as well as maintaining cross-links among different data sources, which are essential for large-scale and automated information integration.},

To address this on-going need, we have developed a web-based data warehouse named SuperTarget, which integrates drug-related information associated with medical indications, adverse drug effects, drug metabolism, pathways and Gene Ontology (GO) terms for target proteins. At present, the updated database contains {\textgreater}6000 target proteins, which are annotated with {\textgreater}330 000 relations to 196 000 compounds (including approved drugs); the vast majority of interactions include binding affinities and pointers to the respective literature sources. The user interface provides tools for drug screening and target similarity inclusion. A query interface enables the user to pose complex queries, for example, to find drugs that target a certain pathway, interacting drugs that are metabolized by the same cytochrome P450 or drugs that target proteins within a certain affinity range.

It is an integrated database consisting of three generic categories of systems information, genomic information and chemical information, and an additional human-specific category of health information. KEGG pathway maps, BRITE hierarchies and KEGG modules have been developed as generic molecular networks with KEGG Orthology nodes of functional orthologs so that KEGG pathway mapping and other procedures can be applied to any cellular organism. Unfortunately, however, this generic approach was inadequate for knowledge representation in the health information category, where variations of human genomes, especially disease-related variations, had to be considered. Thus, we have introduced a new approach where human gene variants are explicitly incorporated into what we call 'network variants' in the recently released KEGG NETWORK database. This allows accumulation of knowledge about disease-related perturbed molecular networks caused not only by gene variants, but also by viruses and other pathogens, environmental factors and drugs. We expect that KEGG NETWORK will become another reference knowledge base for the basic understanding of disease mechanisms and practical use in clinical sequencing and drug development.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies and Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) generate millions of reads and hundreds of datasets, and there is an urgent need for a better way to accurately interpret and distill such large amounts of data. Extensive pathway and network analysis allow for the discovery of highly significant pathways from a set of disease vs. healthy samples in the NGS and GWAS. Knowledge of activation of these processes will lead to elucidation of the complex biological pathways affected by drug treatment, to patient stratification studies of new and existing drug treatments, and to understanding the underlying anti-cancer drug effects. There are approximately 141 biological human pathway resources as of Jan 2012 according to the Pathguide database. However, most currently available resources do not contain disease, drug or organ specificity information such as disease-pathway, drug-pathway, and organ-pathway associations. Systematically integrating pathway, disease, drug and organ specificity together becomes increasingly crucial for understanding the interrelationships between signaling, metabolic and regulatory pathway, drug action, disease susceptibility, and organ specificity from high-throughput omics data (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics).
RESULTS: We designed the Integrated Pathway Analysis Database for Systematic Enrichment Analysis (IPAD, http://bioinfo.hsc.unt.edu/ipad), defining inter-association between pathway, disease, drug and organ specificity, based on six criteria: 1) comprehensive pathway coverage; 2) gene/protein to pathway/disease/drug/organ association; 3) inter-association between pathway, disease, drug, and organ; 4) multiple and quantitative measurement of enrichment and inter-association; 5) assessment of enrichment and inter-association analysis with the context of the existing biological knowledge and a "gold standard" constructed from reputable and reliable sources; and 6) cross-linking of multiple available data sources.IPAD is a comprehensive database covering about 22,498 genes, 25,469 proteins, 1956 pathways, 6704 diseases, 5615 drugs, and 52 organs integrated from databases including the BioCarta, KEGG, NCI-Nature curated, Reactome, CTD, PharmGKB, DrugBank, PharmGKB, and HOMER. The database has a web-based user interface that allows users to perform enrichment analysis from genes/proteins/molecules and inter-association analysis from a pathway, disease, drug, and organ.Moreover, the quality of the database was validated with the context of the existing biological knowledge and a "gold standard" constructed from reputable and reliable sources. Two case studies were also presented to demonstrate: 1) self-validation of enrichment analysis and inter-association analysis on brain-specific markers, and 2) identification of previously undiscovered components by the enrichment analysis from a prostate cancer study.
CONCLUSIONS: IPAD is a new resource for analyzing, identifying, and validating pathway, disease, drug, organ specificity and their inter-associations. The statistical method we developed for enrichment and similarity measurement and the two criteria we described for setting the threshold parameters can be extended to other enrichment applications. Enriched pathways, diseases, drugs, organs and their inter-associations can be searched, displayed, and downloaded from our online user interface. The current IPAD database can help users address a wide range of biological pathway related, disease susceptibility related, drug target related and organ specificity related questions in human disease studies.},

	abstract = {Background
Drug repositioning is a cost-efficient and time-saving process to drug development compared to traditional techniques. A systematic method to drug repositioning is to identify candidate drug's gene expression profiles on target disease models and determine how similar these profiles are to approved drugs. Databases such as the CMAP have been developed recently to help with systematic drug repositioning.

Methods
To overcome the limitation of connectivity maps on data coverage, we constructed a comprehensive in silico drug-protein connectivity map called DMAP, which contains directed drug-to-protein effects and effect scores. The drug-to-protein effect scores are compiled from all database entries between the drug and protein have been previously observed and provide a confidence measure on the quality of such drug-to-protein effects.

Results
In DMAP, we have compiled the direct effects between 24,121 PubChem Compound ID (CID), which were mapped from 289,571 chemical entities recognized from public literature, and 5,196 reviewed Uniprot proteins. DMAP compiles a total of 438,004 chemical-to-protein effect relationships. Compared to CMAP, DMAP shows an increase of 221 folds in the number of chemicals and 1.92 fold in the number of ATC codes. Furthermore, by overlapping DMAP chemicals with the approved drugs with known indications from the TTD database and literature, we obtained 982 drugs and 622 diseases; meanwhile, we only obtained 394 drugs with known indication from CMAP. To validate the feasibility of applying new DMAP for systematic drug repositioning, we compared the performance of DMAP and the well-known CMAP database on two popular computational techniques: drug-drug-similarity-based method with leave-one-out validation and Kolmogorov-Smirnov scoring based method. In drug-drug-similarity-based method, the drug repositioning prediction using DMAP achieved an Area-Under-Curve (AUC) score of 0.82, compared with that using CMAP, AUC = 0.64. For Kolmogorov-Smirnov scoring based method, with DMAP, we were able to retrieve several drug indications which could not be retrieved using CMAP. DMAP data can be queried using the existing C2MAP server or downloaded freely at: http://bio.informatics.iupui.edu/cmaps

Conclusions
Reliable measurements of how drug affect disease-related proteins are critical to ongoing drug development in the genome medicine era.

We show that L1000 is highly reproducible, comparable to RNA sequencing, and suitable for computational inference of the expression levels of 81\% of non-measured transcripts. We further show that the expanded CMap can be used to discover mechanism of action of small molecules, functionally annotate genetic variants of disease genes, and inform clinical trials.

Principles of Human-Computer Interactions are being employed in creating the query interface and user-feedback is being solicited. The data specification includes significant experimental detail. A full dictionary has been created for isothermal titration calorimetry data in consultation with experimentalists and data dictionaries for enzyme-inhibition and other measurement techniques are being developed. Currently, the BindingDB contains several data sets of broad interest, such as antigen-antibody binding and cyclodextrin/small molecule binding. However, it is anticipated that online deposition by experimentalists will ultimately contribute to a larger flow of data.

This combination of features will facilitate cross-species comparisons of toxicologically significant genes and proteins. These comparisons will promote understanding of molecular evolution, the significance of conserved sequences, the genetic basis of variable sensitivity to environmental agents, and the complex interactions between the environment and human health. CTD is currently under development, and the planned scope and functions of the database are described herein.

An easy-to-use query interface enables the user to pose complex queries, for example to find drugs that target a certain pathway, interacting drugs that are metabolized by the same cytochrome P450 or drugs that target the same protein but are metabolized by different enzymes. Furthermore, we provide tools for 2D drug screening and sequence comparison of the targets. The database contains more than 2500 target proteins, which are annotated with about 7300 relations to 1500 drugs; the vast majority of entries have pointers to the respective literature source.

	abstract = {Multiple-hypothesis testing involves guarding against much more complicated errors than single-hypothesis testing. Whereas we typically control the type I error rate for a single-hypothesis test, a compound error rate is controlled for multiple-hypothesis tests. For example, controlling the false discovery rate FDR traditionally involves intricate sequential p-value rejection methods based on the observed data. Whereas a sequential p-value method ﬁxes the error rate and estimates its corresponding rejection region, we propose the opposite approach—we ﬁx the rejection region and then estimate its corresponding error rate. This new approach offers increased applicability, accuracy and power. We apply the methodology to both the positive false discovery rate pFDR and FDR, and provide evidence for its beneﬁts. It is shown that pFDR is probably the quantity of interest over FDR. Also discussed is the calculation of the q-value, the pFDR analogue of the p-value, which eliminates the need to set the error rate beforehand as is traditionally done. Some simple numerical examples are presented that show that this new approach can yield an increase of over eight times in power compared with the Benjamini–Hochberg FDR method.},

DGIdb was assembled through an extensive manual curation effort, reflecting the combined information of twenty-seven sources. For DGIdb 2.0, substantial updates have been made to increase content and improve its usefulness as a resource for mining clinically actionable drug targets. Specifically, nine new sources of drug-gene interactions have been added, including seven resources specifically focused on interactions linked to clinical trials. These additions have more than doubled the overall count of drug-gene interactions. The total number of druggable gene claims has also increased by 30\%. Importantly, a majority of the unrestricted, publicly-accessible sources used in DGIdb are now automatically updated on a weekly basis, providing the most current information for these sources. Finally, a new web view and API have been developed to allow searching for interactions by drug identifiers to complement existing gene-based search functionality.

To address this, we have developed STITCH ('Search Tool for Interacting Chemicals') that integrates these disparate data sources for 430 000 chemicals into a single, easy-to-use resource. In addition to the increased scope of the database, we have implemented a new network view that gives the user the ability to view binding affinities of chemicals in the interaction network. This enables the user to get a quick overview of the potential effects of the chemical on its interaction partners. For each organism, STITCH provides a global network; however, not all proteins have the same pattern of spatial expression. Therefore, only a certain subset of interactions can occur simultaneously. In the new, fifth release of STITCH, we have implemented functionality to filter out the proteins and chemicals not associated with a given tissue. The STITCH database can be downloaded in full, accessed programmatically via an extensive API, or searched via a redesigned web interface at http://stitch.embl.de.},

This information has been manually extracted and manually verified from numerous sources, including other electronic databases, government documents, textbooks and scientific journals. A key focus of the T3DB is on providing 'depth' over 'breadth' with detailed descriptions, mechanisms of action, and information on toxins and toxin-targets. T3DB is fully searchable and supports extensive text, sequence, chemical structure and relational query searches, similar to those found in the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) and DrugBank. Potential applications of the T3DB include clinical metabolomics, toxin target prediction, toxicity prediction and toxicology education. The T3DB is available online at http://www.t3db.org.},

Here we consider a complementary technique that quantitatively groups and relates proteins based on the chemical similarity of their ligands. We began with 65,000 ligands annotated into sets for hundreds of drug targets. The similarity score between each set was calculated using ligand topology. A statistical model was developed to rank the significance of the resulting similarity scores, which are expressed as a minimum spanning tree to map the sets together. Although these maps are connected solely by chemical similarity, biologically sensible clusters nevertheless emerged. Links among unexpected targets also emerged, among them that methadone, emetine and loperamide (Imodium) may antagonize muscarinic M3, alpha2 adrenergic and neurokinin NK2 receptors, respectively. These predictions were subsequently confirmed experimentally. Relating receptors by ligand chemistry organizes biology to reveal unexpected relationships that may be assayed using the ligands themselves.},

	abstract = {A large number of 5-HT receptors ({\textgreater}15) have been identified by molecular cloning technology over the past 10 years. This review briefly summarizes available information regarding the functional and therapeutic implications of serotonin receptor diversity for neurology and psychiatry. 5-HT receptors are divided into seven main families: 5-HT1, 5-HT2, 5-HT3, 5-HT4, 5-HT5, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7. Several families (e.g., 5-HT1 family) have many members (e.g., 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, 5-HT1E, 5-HT1F), each of which is encoded by a distinct gene product. In addition to the genomic diversity of 5-HT receptors, splice variants and editing isoforms exist for many of the 5-HT receptors, making the family even more diverse. Evidence that is summarized in this review suggests that 5-HT receptors represent novel therapeutic targets for a number of neurologic and psychiatric diseases including migraine headaches, chronic pain conditions, schizophrenia, anxiety, depression, eating disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder, pervasive developmental disorders, and obesity-related conditions (Type II diabetes, hypertension, obesity syndromes). It is possible that sub-type-selective serotonergic agents may revolutionize the treatment for a number of medical, psychiatric, and neurological disorders.},

	abstract = {The National Center for Toxicogenomics is developing the first public toxicogenomics knowledge base that combines molecular expression data sets from transcriptomics, proteomics, metabonomics, and conventional toxicology with metabolic, toxicologcal pathway, and gene regulatory network information relevant to environmental toxicology and human disease. It is called the Chemical Effects in Biological Systems (CEBS) knowledge base and is designed to meet the information needs of "systems toxicology," involving the study of perturbation by chemicals and stressors, monitoring changes in molecular expression and conventional toxicological parameters, and iteratively integrating biological response data to describe the functioning organism. Based upon functional genomics approaches used successfully in analyzing yeast gene expression data sets, relational and descriptive compendia will be assembled for toxicologically important genes, groups of genes, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and mutant and knockout phenotypes. CEBS data sets will be fully documented in the experimental protocol and therefore searchable by compound, structure, toxicity end point, pathology and point, gene, gene group, SNP, pathway, and network as a function of dose, time, and the phenotype of the target tissue. A knowledge base is being developed by assimilating toxicological, biological, and chemical information from multiple public domain databases and by progressively refining that information about gene, protein, and metabolite expression for classes of chemicals and their biological effects in various species. By analogy to the GenBank database for genome sequences, researchers will globally query (or BLAST) CEBS using a transcriptome of a tissue of interest (or a list of outliers) to have the knowledge base return information on genes, groups of genes, metabolic and toxicological pathways, and contextually associated phenotypic information for compounds that display similar response profiles. With high-quality data content, CEBS will ultimately become a resource to support hypothesis-driven and discovery research that contributes effectively to drug safety and the improvement of risk assessments for chemicals in the environment. The CEBS development effort will span a decade or more.},

	abstract = {G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent one of the most important families of drug targets in pharmaceutical development. GLIDA is a public GPCR-related Chemical Genomics database that is primarily focused on the integration of information between GPCRs and their ligands. It provides interaction data between GPCRs and their ligands, along with chemical information on the ligands, as well as biological information regarding GPCRs. These data are connected with each other in a relational database, allowing users in the field of Chemical Genomics research to easily retrieve such information from either biological or chemical starting points. GLIDA includes a variety of similarity search functions for the GPCRs and for their ligands. Thus, GLIDA can provide correlation maps linking the searched homologous GPCRs (or ligands) with their ligands (or GPCRs). By analyzing the correlation patterns between GPCRs and ligands, we can gain more detailed knowledge about their conserved molecular recognition patterns and improve drug design efforts by focusing on inferred candidates for GPCR-specific drugs. This article provides a summary of the GLIDA database and user facilities, and describes recent improvements to database design, data contents, ligand classification programs, similarity search options and graphical interfaces. GLIDA is publicly available at http://pharminfo.pharm.kyoto-u.ac.jp/services/glida/. We hope that it will prove very useful for Chemical Genomics research and GPCR-related drug discovery.},

This definition becomes even more important as we try to link drug response to genetic variation, understand stratified clinical efficacy and safety, rationalize the differences between drugs in the same therapeutic class and predict drug utility in patient subgroups. However, drug targets are often poorly defined in the literature, both for launched drugs and for potential therapeutic agents in discovery and development. Here, we present an updated comprehensive map of molecular targets of approved drugs. We curate a total of 893 human and pathogen-derived biomolecules through which 1,578 US FDA-approved drugs act. These biomolecules include 667 human-genome-derived proteins targeted by drugs for human disease. Analysis of these drug targets indicates the continued dominance of privileged target families across disease areas, but also the growth of novel first-in-class mechanisms, particularly in oncology. We explore the relationships between bioactivity class and clinical success, as well as the presence of orthologues between human and animal models and between pathogen and human genomes. Through the collaboration of three independent teams, we highlight some of the ongoing challenges in accurately defining the targets of molecular therapeutics and present conventions for deconvoluting the complexities of molecular pharmacology and drug efficacy.},

In the past the KO database was developed for the purpose of defining nodes of molecular networks, but now the content has been expanded and the quality improved irrespective of whether or not the KOs appear in the three molecular network databases. The newly introduced addendum category of the GENES database is a collection of individual proteins whose functions are experimentally characterized and from which an increasing number of KOs are defined. Furthermore, the DISEASE and DRUG databases have been improved by systematic analysis of drug labels for better integration of diseases and drugs with the KEGG molecular networks.

For example, a user can now upload a spreadsheet with screening hits to easily check which interactions are already known. To increase the coverage of STITCH, we expanded the text mining to include full-text articles and added a prediction method based on chemical structures. We further changed our scheme for transferring interactions between species to rely on orthology rather than protein similarity. This improves the performance within protein families, where scores are now transferred only to orthologous proteins, but not to paralogous proteins.

It is an expert-authored and peer-reviewed, curated collection of well-documented molecular reactions that span the gamut from simple intermediate metabolism to signaling pathways and complex cellular events. This information is supplemented with likely orthologous molecular reactions in mouse, rat, zebrafish, worm and other model organisms. This unit describes how to use the Reactome database to learn the steps of a biological pathway; navigate and browse through the Reactome database; identify the pathways in which a molecule of interest is involved; use the Pathway and Expression analysis tools to search the database for and visualize possible connections within user-supplied experimental data set and Reactome pathways; and the Species Comparison tool to compare human and model organism pathways.},

The present release includes information on the products of 646 genes from four major protein classes (G protein-coupled receptors, nuclear hormone receptors, voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels) and ∼3180 bioactive molecules (endogenous ligands, licensed drugs and key pharmacological tools) that interact with them. We have described previously the classification and curation of data for small molecule ligands in the database; in this update we have annotated 366 endogenous peptide ligands with their amino acid sequences, post-translational modifications, links to precursor genes, species differences and relationships with other molecules in the database (e.g. those derived from the same precursor). We have also matched targets with their endogenous ligands (peptides and small molecules), with particular attention paid to identifying bioactive peptide ligands generated by post-translational modification of precursor proteins. Other improvements to the database include enhanced information on the clinical relevance of targets and ligands in the database, more extensive links to other databases and a pilot project for the curation of enzymes as drug targets.},

	abstract = {The exposome is defined as the totality of all human environmental exposures from conception to death. It is often regarded as the complement to the genome, with the interaction between the exposome and the genome ultimately determining one's phenotype. The 'toxic exposome' is the complete collection of chronically or acutely toxic compounds to which humans can be exposed. Considerable interest in defining the toxic exposome has been spurred on by the realization that most human injuries, deaths and diseases are directly or indirectly caused by toxic substances found in the air, water, food, home or workplace. The Toxin-Toxin-Target Database (T3DB--www.t3db.ca) is a resource that was specifically designed to capture information about the toxic exposome. Originally released in 2010, the first version of T3DB contained data on nearly 2900 common toxic substances along with detailed information on their chemical properties, descriptions, targets, toxic effects, toxicity thresholds, sequences (for both targets and toxins), mechanisms and references. To more closely align itself with the needs of epidemiologists, toxicologists and exposome scientists, the latest release of T3DB has been substantially upgraded to include many more compounds ({\textgreater}3600), targets ({\textgreater}2000) and gene expression datasets ({\textgreater}15,000 genes). It now includes extensive data on 'normal' toxic compound concentrations in human biofluids as well as detailed chemical taxonomies, informative chemical ontologies and a large number of referential NMR, MS/MS and GC-MS spectra. This manuscript describes the most recent update to the T3DB, which was previously featured in the 2010 NAR Database Issue.},

We also report a 46\% increase in CTD manually curated content, which when integrated with other datasets yields more than 38 million toxicogenomic relationships. We describe new querying and display features for our enhanced chemical-exposure science module, providing greater scope of content and utility. As well, we discuss an updated MEDIC disease vocabulary with over 1700 new terms and accession identifiers. To accommodate these increases in data content and functionality, CTD has upgraded its computational infrastructure. These updates continue to improve CTD and help inform new testable hypotheses about the etiology and mechanisms underlying environmentally influenced diseases.},

	abstract = {Ten years ago, the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD; http://ctdbase.org/) was developed out of a need to formalize, harmonize and centralize the information on numerous genes and proteins responding to environmental toxic agents across diverse species. CTD's initial approach was to facilitate comparisons of nucleotide and protein sequences of toxicologically significant genes by curating these sequences and electronically annotating them with chemical terms from their associated references. Since then, however, CTD has vastly expanded its scope to robustly represent a triad of chemical-gene, chemical-disease and gene-disease interactions that are manually curated from the scientific literature by professional biocurators using controlled vocabularies, ontologies and structured notation. Today, CTD includes 24 million toxicogenomic connections relating chemicals/drugs, genes/proteins, diseases, taxa, phenotypes, Gene Ontology annotations, pathways and interaction modules. In this 10th year anniversary update, we outline the evolution of CTD, including our increased data content, new 'Pathway View' visualization tool, enhanced curation practices, pilot chemical-phenotype results and impending exposure data set. The prototype database originally described in our first report has transformed into a sophisticated resource used actively today to help scientists develop and test hypotheses about the etiologies of environmentally influenced diseases.},

They join the expanding universes of cheminformatics via chemical structures on the one hand and bioinformatics via sequences on the other. However, it is difficult to assess the relative utility of databases without the explicit comparison of content. We have exemplified an approach to this by comparing resources that each has a different focus on bioactive chemistry (ChEMBL, DrugBank, Human Metabolome Database, and Therapeutic Target Database) both at the chemical structure and protein levels. We compared the compound sets at different representational stringencies using NCI/CADD Structure Identifiers. The overlap and uniqueness in chemical content can be broadly interpreted in the context of different data capture strategies. However, we recorded apparent anomalies, such as many compounds-in-common between the metabolite and drug databases. We also compared the content of sequences mapped to the compounds via their UniProt protein identifiers. While these were also generally interpretable in the context of individual databases we discerned differences in coverage and the types of supporting data used. For example, the target concept is applied differently between DrugBank and the Therapeutic Target Database. In ChEMBL it encompasses a broader range of mappings from chemical biology and species orthologue cross-screening in addition to drug targets per se. Our analysis should assist users not only in exploiting the synergies between these four high-value resources but also in assessing the utility of other databases at the interface of chemistry and biology.},

Rational approaches in which structural features from selective ligands are combined have produced designed multiple ligands that span a wide variety of targets and target classes. A key challenge in the design of multiple ligands is attaining a balanced activity at each target of interest while simultaneously achieving a wider selectivity and a suitable pharmacokinetic profile. An analysis of literature examples reveals trends and insights that might help medicinal chemists discover the next generation of these types of compounds.},

It contains information on a broad range of chemical entities, including small molecules, lipids, carbohydrates, and (chemically modified) amino acid and nucleic acid sequences (including siRNA and miRNA). Currently (as of Nov. 2015), PubChem contains more than 150 million depositor-provided chemical substance descriptions, 60 million unique chemical structures, and 225 million biological activity test results provided from over 1 million biological assay records.
DESCRIPTION: Many PubChem records (substances, compounds, and assays) include depositor-provided cross-references to scientific articles in PubMed. Some PubChem contributors provide bioactivity data extracted from scientific articles. Literature-derived bioactivity data complement high-throughput screening (HTS) data from the concluded NIH Molecular Libraries Program and other HTS projects. Some journals provide PubChem with information on chemicals that appear in their newly published articles, enabling concurrent publication of scientific articles in journals and associated data in public databases. In addition, PubChem links records to PubMed articles indexed with the Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) controlled vocabulary thesaurus.
CONCLUSION: Literature information, both provided by depositors and derived from MeSH annotations, can be accessed using PubChem's web interfaces, enabling users to explore information available in literature related to PubChem records beyond typical web search results.

Separate display of stereoisomers is necessary, for example, for carbohydrates and chiral drugs.

Previous GBD studies have shown how the decline of mortality rates from 1990 to 2016 has led to an increase in life expectancy, an ageing global population, and an expansion of the non-fatal burden of disease and injury. These studies have also shown how a substantial portion of the world's population experiences non-fatal health loss with considerable heterogeneity among different causes, locations, ages, and sexes. Ongoing objectives of the GBD study include increasing the level of estimation detail, improving analytical strategies, and increasing the amount of high-quality data.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Methods{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}We estimated incidence and prevalence for 354 diseases and injuries and 3484 sequelae. We used an updated and extensive body of literature studies, survey data, surveillance data, inpatient admission records, outpatient visit records, and health insurance claims, and additionally used results from cause of death models to inform estimates using a total of 68 781 data sources. Newly available clinical data from India, Iran, Japan, Jordan, Nepal, China, Brazil, Norway, and Italy were incorporated, as well as updated claims data from the USA and new claims data from Taiwan (province of China) and Singapore. We used DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, as the main method of estimation, ensuring consistency between rates of incidence, prevalence, remission, and cause of death for each condition. YLDs were estimated as the product of a prevalence estimate and a disability weight for health states of each mutually exclusive sequela, adjusted for comorbidity. We updated the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary development indicator of income per capita, years of schooling, and total fertility rate. Additionally, we calculated differences between male and female YLDs to identify divergent trends across sexes. GBD 2017 complies with the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Findings{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Globally, for females, the causes with the greatest age-standardised prevalence were oral disorders, headache disorders, and haemoglobinopathies and haemolytic anaemias in both 1990 and 2017. For males, the causes with the greatest age-standardised prevalence were oral disorders, headache disorders, and tuberculosis including latent tuberculosis infection in both 1990 and 2017. In terms of YLDs, low back pain, headache disorders, and dietary iron deficiency were the leading Level 3 causes of YLD counts in 1990, whereas low back pain, headache disorders, and depressive disorders were the leading causes in 2017 for both sexes combined. All-cause age-standardised YLD rates decreased by 3·9\% (95\% uncertainty interval [UI] 3·1–4·6) from 1990 to 2017; however, the all-age YLD rate increased by 7·2\% (6·0–8·4) while the total sum of global YLDs increased from 562 million (421–723) to 853 million (642–1100). The increases for males and females were similar, with increases in all-age YLD rates of 7·9\% (6·6–9·2) for males and 6·5\% (5·4–7·7) for females. We found significant differences between males and females in terms of age-standardised prevalence estimates for multiple causes. The causes with the greatest relative differences between sexes in 2017 included substance use disorders (3018 cases [95\% UI 2782–3252] per 100 000 in males \textit{vs} s1400 [1279–1524] per 100 000 in females), transport injuries (3322 [3082–3583] \textit{vs} 2336 [2154–2535]), and self-harm and interpersonal violence (3265 [2943–3630] \textit{vs} 5643 [5057–6302]).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Interpretation{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Global all-cause age-standardised YLD rates have improved only slightly over a period spanning nearly three decades. However, the magnitude of the non-fatal disease burden has expanded globally, with increasing numbers of people who have a wide spectrum of conditions. A subset of conditions has remained globally pervasive since 1990, whereas other conditions have displayed more dynamic trends, with different ages, sexes, and geographies across the globe experiencing varying burdens and trends of health loss. This study emphasises how global improvements in premature mortality for select conditions have led to older populations with complex and potentially expensive diseases, yet also highlights global achievements in certain domains of disease and injury.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Funding{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Bill \& Melinda Gates Foundation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Drug repurposing is a promising, fast, and cost effective method that can overcome traditional de novo drug discovery and development challenges of targeting neuropsychiatric and other disorders. Drug discovery and development targeting neuropsychiatric disorders are complicated because of the limitations in understanding pathophysiological phenomena. In addition, traditional de novo drug discovery and development are risky, expensive, and time-consuming processes. One alternative approach, drug repurposing, has emerged taking advantage of off-target effects of the existing drugs. In order to identify new opportunities for the existing drugs, it is essential for us to understand the mechanisms of action of drugs, both biologically and pharmacologically. By doing this, drug repurposing would be a more effective method to develop drugs against neuropsychiatric and other disorders. Here, we review the difficulties in drug discovery and development in neuropsychiatric disorders and the extent and perspectives of drug repurposing.},

	abstract = {Purpose
Atypical antipsychotics (AAs), an effective treatment for schizophrenia, have a range of pharmacologic properties leading to differences in tolerability as well as heterogeneity in treatment response. Individual patient characteristics must be considered when making treatment choices, especially from an adverse event (AE) or tolerability perspective. Despite the availability of numerous AAs, after appraising patient characteristics at the time of treatment selection, physicians may quickly run out of tolerable treatment options.

Patients and methods
AE risk factors, defined as having either a prior history of an AE or a risk factor for that AE, were determined for Medicaid-insured and Commercially insured patients using database analysis. Patients receiving AA treatment between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2012 defined the index date of first observed AA prescription during this period. Nine AAs were evaluated for association with AE risk factors as informed by drug prescribing information from the different manufacturers and published meta-analyses. The proportion of patients with pre-index AE risk factors prescribed an AA associated with that risk factor was then determined.

Results
A high proportion of patients ({\textgreater}80\%) were prescribed an AA associated with extrapyramidal symptoms or akathisia despite experiencing extrapyramidal symptoms or akathisia prior to AA treatment initiation. Similar trends were observed among patients with diabetes ({\textgreater}60\%) and obesity ({\textgreater}40\%). From the nine treatment options available, the number of optimal choices for individual patient segments were limited based on their prior history, including those with cardiometabolic and cardiovascular comorbidities (four); experiencing prolactin elevation-related problems (seven); needing to avoid excessive sedation (four); or at risk of extrapyramidal symptoms or akathisia (two). Options were then further restricted among patients in more than one segment when multiple pre-index AE risk factors were combined.

Conclusion
When combining patient risk profile with antipsychotic AE profile, physicians may quickly run out of tolerable treatment options for individual patients, despite the availability of many AAs, suggesting a need for additional treatment options with better tolerability and without compromising efficacy.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) drug developments and clinical trials (CT) remain vulnerable to problems that undermine research validity. Investigations of CT methods reveal how numerous factors decrease active drug-placebo group differences and increase variance, thereby reducing power to reach statistical significance for outcome measure differences in AD CTs. Such factors include, amongst many, inaccuracy, imprecision, bias, failures to follow or lack of operational protocols for applying CT methods, inter-site variance, lack of homogeneous sampling using disorder criteria. After a review of the literature and survey of a sample of AD and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) CTs, the authors question whether problems of human error preclude AD researchers from continuing their dependence on rated outcome measures for CTs. The authors propose that the realities of AD, especially a probable irreversible progression of neuropathology prior to onset of clinical symptoms or signs capable of differentiating persons at risk for AD from normal aged, require AD investigators and clinicians to privilege biomarkers and encourage their development as surrogate targets for preventive AD treatment developments, testing, and use in clinical practice.},

Secondary outcomes included the other IIEF questions and functional domains, the Life Satisfaction Checklist, the Erectile Dysfunction Inventory of Treatment Satisfaction, 2 global efficacy assessment questions, and intercourse success rate. By week 12, sildenafil-treated patients (n = 70) showed significant improvements on questions 3 and 4 compared with placebo-treated patients (n = 72; p {\textless}0.01). Larger percentages of sildenafil-treated patients reported improved erections (64\%) and improved intercourse (65\%) compared with placebo-treated patients (21\% and 19\%, respectively). Sildenafil-treated patients were highly satisfied with treatment and their sexual life compared with placebo-treated patients. Forty-seven percent of sildenafil- and 32\% of placebo-treated patients experienced adverse events, including transient headache, hypertension, flushing, and dyspepsia. There were no serious drug-related cardiovascular effects. Thus, sildenafil is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for ED in men with CAD.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with myeloma who relapse after high-dose chemotherapy have few therapeutic options. Since increased bone marrow vascularity imparts a poor prognosis in myeloma, we evaluated the efficacy of thalidomide, which has antiangiogenic properties, in patients with refractory disease.
METHODS: Eighty-four previously treated patients with refractory myeloma (76 with a relapse after high-dose chemotherapy) received oral thalidomide as a single agent for a median of 80 days (range, 2 to 465). The starting dose was 200 mg daily, and the dose was increased by 200 mg every two weeks until it reached 800 mg per day. Response was assessed on the basis of a reduction of the myeloma protein in serum or Bence Jones protein in urine that lasted for at least six weeks.
RESULTS: The serum or urine levels of paraprotein were reduced by at least 90 percent in eight patients (two had a complete remission), at least 75 percent in six patients, at least 50 percent in seven patients, and at least 25 percent in six patients, for a total rate of response of 32 percent. Reductions in the paraprotein levels were apparent within two months in 78 percent of the patients with a response and were associated with decreased numbers of plasma cells in bone marrow and increased hemoglobin levels. The microvascular density of bone marrow did not change significantly in patients with a response. At least one third of the patients had mild or moderate constipation, weakness or fatigue, or somnolence. More severe adverse effects were infrequent (occurring in less than 10 percent of patients), and hematologic effects were rare. As of the most recent follow-up, 36 patients had died (30 with no response and 6 with a response). After 12 months of follow-up, Kaplan-Meier estimates of the mean (+/-SE) rates of event-free survival and overall survival for all patients were 22+/-5 percent and 58+/-5 percent, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Thalidomide is active against advanced myeloma. It can induce marked and durable responses in some patients with multiple myeloma, including those who relapse after high-dose chemotherapy.},

We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common.

However, a major challenge of this approach is to identify the causal gene(s) at the observed QTLs. Here, we present a framework for the 'Prioritization of candidate causal Genes at Molecular QTLs' (ProGeM), which incorporates biological domain-specific annotation data alongside genome annotation data from multiple repositories. We assessed the performance of ProGeM using a reference set of 227 previously reported and extensively curated metabolite QTLs. For 98\% of these loci, the expert-curated gene was one of the candidate causal genes prioritized by ProGeM. Benchmarking analyses revealed that 69\% of the causal candidates were nearest to the sentinel variant at the investigated molecular QTLs, indicating that genomic proximity is the most reliable indicator of 'true positive' causal genes. In contrast, cis-gene expression QTL data led to three false positive candidate causal gene assignments for every one true positive assignment. We provide evidence that these conclusions also apply to other molecular phenotypes, suggesting that ProGeM is a powerful and versatile tool for annotating molecular QTLs. ProGeM is freely available via GitHub.},

	abstract = {This is a major update that is being released simultaneously with version 0.9.1. It has all of the same features (and bugs!) as 0.9.1, but there are important changes to the dependencies. Most notably, all support for Python 2 has now been dropped. Support for Python 3.5 has also been dropped. Seaborn is now strictly compatible with Python 3.6+. Minimally supported versions of the dependent PyData libraries have also been increased, in some cases substantially. While seaborn has tended to be very conservative about maintaining compatibility with older dependencies, this was causing increasing pain during development. At the same time, these libraries are now much easier to install. Going forward, seaborn will likely stay close to the Numpy community guidelines for version support. This release also removes a few previously-deprecated features: The tsplot function and seaborn.timeseries module have been removed. Recall that tsplot was replaced with lineplot. The seaborn.apionly entry-point has been removed. The seaborn.linearmodels module (previously renamed to seaborn.regression) has been removed. Looking forward Now that seaborn is a Python 3 library, it can take advantage of keyword-only arguments. It is likely that future versions will introduce this syntax, potentially in a breaking way. For guidance, most seaborn functions have a signature that looks like func(x, y, ..., data=None, **kwargs) where the **kwargs are specified in the function. Going forward it will likely be necessary to specify data and all subsequent arguments with an explicit key=value mapping. This style has long been used throughout the documentation, and the formal requirement will not be introduced until at least the next major release. Adding this feature will make it possible to enhance some older functions with more modern capabilities (e.g., adding a native hue semantic within functions like jointplot and regplot).},

We explored this by analyzing seven datasets that varied by ancestry (African American vs. Caucasian), developmental stage (neonate vs. adult), and tissue type (blood vs. four regions of postmortem brain) with genome-wide DNA methylation and SNP data. We tested for meQTLs by constructing linear regression models of methylation levels at each CpG site on SNP genotypes within 50 kb under an additive model controlling for multiple tests.},

	abstract = {Thiazides best first choice for hypertension
        , 
          Review Question(s)
        , In this first update of a review published in 2009, we wanted to determine which drug class was the best first‐line choice in treating adult patients with raised blood pressure., We searched the available medical literature to find all the trials that compared the drugs to placebo or no treatment to assess this question. The data included in this review are up to date as of November 2017., 
          Background
        , High blood pressure or hypertension can increase the risk of heart attacks and stroke. One of the most important decisions in treating people with elevated blood pressure is what drug class to use first. This decision has important consequences in terms of health outcomes and cost., 
          Study characteristics
        , We found no new trials in this updated search. In the original review, we found 24 studies that randomly assigned 58,040 adult people (mean age 62 years) with high blood pressure, to four different drug classes or placebo. Duration of these studies ranged from three to five years. Drug classes studied included thiazide diuretics, beta‐blockers, ACE inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers., 
          Key Results
        , We concluded that most of the evidence demonstrated that first‐line low‐dose thiazides reduced mortality, stroke, and heart attack. No other drug class improved health outcomes better than low‐dose thiazides. Beta‐blockers and high‐dose thiazides were inferior., 
          Conclusions
        , High‐quality evidence supported that low‐dose thiazides should be used first for most patients with elevated blood pressure. Fortunately, thiazides are also very inexpensive., 
          Quality of evidence
        , The evidence for first‐line low dose thiazides was high quality. For the other classes, we judged the evidence to be moderate or low quality.},

	abstract = {Antihypertensives are a class of drugs that are used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure). Antihypertensive therapy seeks to prevent the complications of high blood pressure, such as stroke and myocardial infarction. Evidence suggests that reduction of the blood pressure by 5 mmHg can decrease the risk of stroke by 34\%, of ischaemic heart disease by 21\%, and reduce the likelihood of dementia, heart failure, and mortality from cardiovascular disease. There are many classes of antihypertensives, which lower blood pressure by different means. Among the most important and most widely used medications are thiazide diuretics, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists (ARBs), and beta blockers.
Which type of medication to use initially for hypertension has been the subject of several large studies and resulting national guidelines. The fundamental goal of treatment should be the prevention of the important endpoints of hypertension, such as heart attack, stroke and heart failure. Patient age, associated clinical conditions and end-organ damage also play a part in determining dosage and type of medication administered. The several classes of antihypertensives differ in side effect profiles, ability to prevent endpoints, and cost. The choice of more expensive agents, where cheaper ones would be equally effective, may have negative impacts on national healthcare budgets. As of 2018, the best available evidence favors low-dose thiazide diuretics as the first-line treatment of choice for high blood pressure when drugs are necessary. Although clinical evidence shows calcium channel blockers and thiazide-type diuretics are preferred first-line treatments for most people (from both efficacy and cost points of view), an ACE inhibitor is recommended by NICE in the UK for those under 55 years old.},

	abstract = {Background—Plasma lipid levels as well as coronary artery disease (CAD) have been shown to be highly heritable with estimates ranging from 40\% to 60\%. However, top variants detected by large-scale genome-wide association studies explain only a fraction of the total variance in plasma lipid phenotypes and CAD.Methods and Results—We performed a conditional and joint association analysis using summary-level statistics from 2 large genome-wide association meta-analyses: the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium (GLGC) study, and the Coronary Artery Disease Genome-Wide Replication and Meta-Analysis (CARDIoGRAM) study. There were 100 184 individuals from 46 GLGC studies for plasma lipids, and 22 233 cases and 64 762 controls from 14 studies for CAD. We detected several loci where multiple independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms were associated with lipid traits within a locus (12 out of 33 loci for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 10 of 35 loci for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 13 of 44 loci for total cholesterol, and 8 of 28 loci for triglycerides), reaching genome-wide significance (P{\textless}5×10−8), nearly doubling the heritability explained by genome-wide association studies (from 3.6 to 7.6\% for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, from 5.0 to 8.8\% for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, from 5.5 to 8.8\% for total cholesterol, and from 5.7 to 8.5\% for triglycerides). Multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms were also associated with CAD (3 of 15 loci; an increase from 9.6\% to 11.4\% of heritability explained).Conclusions—These results demonstrate that a portion of the missing heritability for lipid traits and CAD can be explained by multiple variants at each locus.},

	abstract = {The known genetic architecture of blood pressure now comprises {\textgreater}30 genes, with rare variants resulting in monogenic forms of hypertension or hypotension and {\textgreater}1,477 common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) being associated with the blood pressure phenotype. Monogenic blood pressure syndromes predominantly involve the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system and the adrenal glucocorticoid pathway, with a smaller fraction caused by neuroendocrine tumours of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. The SNPs identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) as being associated with the blood pressure phenotype explain only approximately 27\% of the 30–50\% estimated heritability of blood pressure, and the effect of each SNP on the blood pressure phenotype is small. A paucity of SNPs from GWAS are mapped to known genes causing monogenic blood pressure syndromes. For example, a GWAS signal mapped to the gene encoding uromodulin has been shown to affect blood pressure by influencing sodium homeostasis, and the effects of another GWAS signal were mediated by endothelin. However, the majority of blood pressure-associated SNPs show pleiotropic associations. Unravelling these associations can potentially help us to understand the underlying biological pathways. In this Review, we appraise the current knowledge of blood pressure genomics, explore the causal pathways for hypertension identified in Mendelian randomization studies and highlight the opportunities for drug repurposing and pharmacogenomics for the treatment of hypertension.},

	abstract = {Understanding the genetic mechanisms underlying natural variation in gene expression is a central goal of both medical and evolutionary genetics, and studies of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) have become an important tool for achieving this goal. Although all eQTL studies so far have assayed messenger RNA levels using expression microarrays, recent advances in RNA sequencing enable the analysis of transcript variation at unprecedented resolution. We sequenced RNA from 69 lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from unrelated Nigerian individuals that have been extensively genotyped by the International HapMap Project. By pooling data from all individuals, we generated a map of the transcriptional landscape of these cells, identifying extensive use of unannotated untranslated regions and more than 100 new putative protein-coding exons. Using the genotypes from the HapMap project, we identified more than a thousand genes at which genetic variation influences overall expression levels or splicing. We demonstrate that eQTLs near genes generally act by a mechanism involving allele-specific expression, and that variation that influences the inclusion of an exon is enriched within and near the consensus splice sites. Our results illustrate the power of high-throughput sequencing for the joint analysis of variation in transcription, splicing and allele-specific expression across individuals.},

To investigate the genetics of gene expression, we performed cis- and trans-expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analyses using blood-derived expression from 31,684 individuals through the eQTLGen Consortium. We detected cis-eQTL for 88\% of genes, and these were replicable in numerous tissues. Distal trans-eQTL (detected for 37\% of 10,317 trait-associated variants tested) showed lower replication rates, partially due to low replication power and confounding by cell type composition. However, replication analyses in single-cell RNA-seq data prioritized intracellular trans-eQTL. Trans-eQTL exerted their effects via several mechanisms, primarily through regulation by transcription factors. Expression of 13\% of the genes correlated with polygenic scores for 1,263 phenotypes, pinpointing potential drivers for those traits. In summary, this work represents a large eQTL resource, and its results serve as a starting point for in-depth interpretation of complex phenotypes.},

Multiple unlinked variants, associated to the same complex trait, often converged on trans-genes that are known to play central roles in disease etiology.We observed the same when ascertaining the effect of polygenic scores calculated for 1,263 genome-wide association study (GWAS) traits. Expression levels of 13\% of the studied genes correlated with polygenic scores, and many resulting genes are known to drive these traits.},

Over 100 genetic loci harbor schizophrenia-associated variants, yet how these variants confer liability is uncertain. The CommonMind Consortium sequenced RNA from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of people with schizophrenia (N = 258) and control subjects (N = 279), creating a resource of gene expression and its genetic regulation. Using this resource, ∼20\% of schizophrenia loci have variants that could contribute to altered gene expression and liability. In five loci, only a single gene was involved: FURIN, TSNARE1, CNTN4, CLCN3 or SNAP91. Altering expression of FURIN, TSNARE1 or CNTN4 changed neurodevelopment in zebrafish; knockdown of FURIN in human neural progenitor cells yielded abnormal migration. Of 693 genes showing significant case-versus-control differential expression, their fold changes were ≤ 1.33, and an independent cohort yielded similar results. Gene co-expression implicates a network relevant for schizophrenia. Our findings show that schizophrenia is polygenic and highlight the utility of this resource for mechanistic interpretations of genetic liability for brain diseases.},

	abstract = {Importance: Substantial genome-wide association study (GWAS) work in Parkinson disease (PD) has led to the discovery of an increasing number of loci shown reliably to be associated with increased risk of disease. Improved understanding of the underlying genes and mechanisms at these loci will be key to understanding the pathogenesis of PD.
Objective: To investigate what genes and genomic processes underlie the risk of sporadic PD.
Design and Setting: This genetic association study used the bioinformatic tools Coloc and transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) to integrate PD case-control GWAS data published in 2017 with expression data (from Braineac, the Genotype-Tissue Expression [GTEx], and CommonMind) and methylation data (derived from UK Parkinson brain samples) to uncover putative gene expression and splicing mechanisms associated with PD GWAS signals. Candidate genes were further characterized using cell-type specificity, weighted gene coexpression networks, and weighted protein-protein interaction networks.
Main Outcomes and Measures: It was hypothesized a priori that some genes underlying PD loci would alter PD risk through changes to expression, splicing, or methylation. Candidate genes are presented whose change in expression, splicing, or methylation are associated with risk of PD as well as the functional pathways and cell types in which these genes have an important role.
Results: Gene-level analysis of expression revealed 5 genes (WDR6 [OMIM 606031], CD38 [OMIM 107270], GPNMB [OMIM 604368], RAB29 [OMIM 603949], and TMEM163 [OMIM 618978]) that replicated using both Coloc and TWAS analyses in both the GTEx and Braineac expression data sets. A further 6 genes (ZRANB3 [OMIM 615655], PCGF3 [OMIM 617543], NEK1 [OMIM 604588], NUPL2 [NCBI 11097], GALC [OMIM 606890], and CTSB [OMIM 116810]) showed evidence of disease-associated splicing effects. Cell-type specificity analysis revealed that gene expression was overall more prevalent in glial cell types compared with neurons. The weighted gene coexpression performed on the GTEx data set showed that NUPL2 is a key gene in 3 modules implicated in catabolic processes associated with protein ubiquitination and in the ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process in the nucleus accumbens, caudate, and putamen. TMEM163 and ZRANB3 were both important in modules in the frontal cortex and caudate, respectively, indicating regulation of signaling and cell communication. Protein interactor analysis and simulations using random networks demonstrated that the candidate genes interact significantly more with known mendelian PD and parkinsonism proteins than would be expected by chance.
Conclusions and Relevance: Together, these results suggest that several candidate genes and pathways are associated with the findings observed in PD GWAS studies.},

	abstract = {Understanding relationships between sets is an important analysis task that has received widespread attention in the visualization community. The major challenge in this context is the combinatorial explosion of the number of set intersections if the number of sets exceeds a trivial threshold. In this paper we introduce UpSet, a novel visualization technique for the quantitative analysis of sets, their intersections, and aggregates of intersections. UpSet is focused on creating task-driven aggregates, communicating the size and properties of aggregates and intersections, and a duality between the visualization of the elements in a dataset and their set membership. UpSet visualizes set intersections in a matrix layout and introduces aggregates based on groupings and queries. The matrix layout enables the effective representation of associated data, such as the number of elements in the aggregates and intersections, as well as additional summary statistics derived from subset or element attributes. Sorting according to various measures enables a task-driven analysis of relevant intersections and aggregates. The elements represented in the sets and their associated attributes are visualized in a separate view. Queries based on containment in specific intersections, aggregates or driven by attribute filters are propagated between both views. We also introduce several advanced visual encodings and interaction methods to overcome the problems of varying scales and to address scalability. UpSet is web-based and open source. We demonstrate its general utility in multiple use cases from various domains.},

	abstract = {Background
We aimed to analyze the association between hypertension and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) after orthopedic surgery.

Methods
Relevant studies were identified by a search of PubMed, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, the Chinese Biomedical Literature, and Weipu database until December 2015. The association between hypertension and DVT after orthopedic surgery was assessed by pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95 \% confidence intervals (CIs). Heterogeneity was evaluated by the Chi-square test based on Q statistic and I2 statistics. Finally, publication bias was evaluated by Egger’s test.

Results
A total of 16 articles with 68,955 males and 53,057 females were eventually identified. Studies yielded effects for homogeneous (Q = 38.41, P = 0.0008, and I2 = 60.9 \%). Meta-analysis showed that hypertension was associated with DVT orthopedic surgery (OR 2.89, 95 \% CI 2.18–3.83, Z = 7.38, P {\textless} 0.05). No statistical evidence of publication bias was found among studies (t = 1.90, P = 0.08). The funnel plot was symmetry, and the results were reliable.

Conclusions
Hypertension may promote DVT after orthopedic surgery, and may be an important risk factor of DVT occurrence.},

	abstract = {We previously presented the protein-protein interaction network of schizophrenia associated genes, and from it, the drug-protein interactome which showed the drugs that target any of the proteins in the interactome. Here, we studied these drugs further to identify whether any of them may potentially be repurposable for schizophrenia. In schizophrenia, gene expression has been described as a measurable aspect of the disease reflecting the action of risk genes. We studied each of the drugs from the interactome using the BaseSpace Correlation Engine, and shortlisted those that had a negative correlation with differential gene expression of schizophrenia. This analysis resulted in 12 drugs whose differential gene expression (drug versus normal) had an anti-correlation with differential expression for schizophrenia (disorder versus normal). Some of these drugs were already being tested for their clinical activity in schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders. Several proteins in the protein interactome of the targets of several of these drugs were associated with various neuropsychiatric disorders. The network of genes with opposite drug-induced versus schizophrenia-associated expression profiles were significantly enriched in pathways relevant to schizophrenia etiology and GWAS genes associated with traits or diseases that had a pathophysiological overlap with schizophrenia. Drugs that targeted the same genes as the shortlisted drugs, have also demonstrated clinical activity in schizophrenia and other related disorders. This integrated computational analysis will help translate insights from the schizophrenia drug-protein interactome to clinical research - an important step, especially in the field of psychiatric drug development which faces a high failure rate.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Magnesium is an essential cation involved in many functions within the central nervous system, including transmission and intracellular signal transduction. Several studies have shown its usefulness in neurological and psychiatric diseases. Furthermore, it seems that magnesium levels are lowered in the course of several mental disorders, especially depression. Objectives: In this study, we wish to evaluate the presence of a relationship between the levels of magnesium and the presence of psychiatric pathology as well as the effectiveness of magnesium as a therapeutic supplementation. Methods: A systematic search of scientific records concerning magnesium in psychiatric disorders published from 2010 up to March 2020 was performed. We collected a total of 32 articles: 18 on Depressive Disorders (DD), four on Anxiety Disorders (AD), four on Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), three on Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), one on Obsessive–Compulsive Disorder (OCD), one on Schizophrenia (SCZ) and one on Eating Disorders (ED). Results: Twelve studies highlighted mainly positive results in depressive symptoms. Seven showed a significant correlation between reduced plasma magnesium values and depression measured with psychometric scales. Two papers reported improved depressive symptoms after magnesium intake, two in association with antidepressants, compared to controls. No significant association between magnesium serum levels and panic or Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) patients, in two distinct papers, was found. In two other papers, a reduced Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) score in depressed patients correlated with higher levels of magnesium and beneficial levels of magnesium in stressed patients was found. Two papers reported low levels of magnesium in association with ADHD. Only one of three papers showed lower levels of magnesium in ASD. ED and SCZ reported a variation in magnesium levels in some aspects of the disease. Conclusion: The results are not univocal, both in terms of the plasma levels and of therapeutic effects. However, from the available evidence, it emerged that supplementation with magnesium could be beneficial. Therefore, it is necessary to design ad hoc clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of magnesium alone or together with other drugs (antidepressants) in order to establish the correct use of this cation with potential therapeutic effects.},

Psychiatric genomics has progressed rapidly in the last decade, shedding light on the biological makeup of cross-disorder risk at multiple levels of analysis. Over a hundred genetic variants have been identified that affect multiple disorders, with many more to be uncovered as sample sizes continue to grow. Cross-disorder mechanistic studies build on these findings to cluster transdiagnostic variants into meaningful categories, including in what tissues or when in development these variants are expressed. At the uppermost level, methods have been developed to estimate the overall shared genetic signal across pairs of traits (i.e., SNP-based genetic correlations) and subsequently model these relationships to identify overarching, genomic risk factors. These factors can subsequently be associated with external traits (e.g., functional imaging phenotypes) to begin to understand the makeup of these transdiagnostic risk factors. As psychiatric genomic efforts continue to expand, we can begin to gain even greater insight by including more fine-grained phenotypes (i.e., symptom-level data) and explicitly considering the environment. The culmination of these efforts will help to inform bottom-up revisions of our current nosology.},

	abstract = {Bipolar disorder is a heritable mental illness with complex etiology. We performed a genome-wide association study of 41,917 bipolar disorder cases and 371,549 controls of European ancestry, which identified 64 associated genomic loci. Bipolar disorder risk alleles were enriched in genes in synaptic signaling pathways and brain-expressed genes, particularly those with high specificity of expression in neurons of the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Significant signal enrichment was found in genes encoding targets of antipsychotics, calcium channel blockers, antiepileptics and anesthetics. Integrating expression quantitative trait locus data implicated 15 genes robustly linked to bipolar disorder via gene expression, encoding druggable targets such as HTR6, MCHR1, DCLK3 and FURIN. Analyses of bipolar disorder subtypes indicated high but imperfect genetic correlation between bipolar disorder type I and II and identified additional associated loci. Together, these results advance our understanding of the biological etiology of bipolar disorder, identify novel therapeutic leads and prioritize genes for functional follow-up studies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in Parkinson's disease have increased the scope of biological knowledge about the disease over the past decade. We aimed to use the largest aggregate of GWAS data to identify novel risk loci and gain further insight into the causes of Parkinson's disease.
METHODS: We did a meta-analysis of 17 datasets from Parkinson's disease GWAS available from European ancestry samples to nominate novel loci for disease risk. These datasets incorporated all available data. We then used these data to estimate heritable risk and develop predictive models of this heritability. We also used large gene expression and methylation resources to examine possible functional consequences as well as tissue, cell type, and biological pathway enrichments for the identified risk factors. Additionally, we examined shared genetic risk between Parkinson's disease and other phenotypes of interest via genetic correlations followed by Mendelian randomisation.
FINDINGS: Between Oct 1, 2017, and Aug 9, 2018, we analysed 7·8 million single nucleotide polymorphisms in 37 688 cases, 18 618 UK Biobank proxy-cases (ie, individuals who do not have Parkinson's disease but have a first degree relative that does), and 1·4 million controls. We identified 90 independent genome-wide significant risk signals across 78 genomic regions, including 38 novel independent risk signals in 37 loci. These 90 variants explained 16-36\% of the heritable risk of Parkinson's disease depending on prevalence. Integrating methylation and expression data within a Mendelian randomisation framework identified putatively associated genes at 70 risk signals underlying GWAS loci for follow-up functional studies. Tissue-specific expression enrichment analyses suggested Parkinson's disease loci were heavily brain-enriched, with specific neuronal cell types being implicated from single cell data. We found significant genetic correlations with brain volumes (false discovery rate-adjusted p=0·0035 for intracranial volume, p=0·024 for putamen volume), smoking status (p=0·024), and educational attainment (p=0·038). Mendelian randomisation between cognitive performance and Parkinson's disease risk showed a robust association (p=8·00 × 10-7).
INTERPRETATION: These data provide the most comprehensive survey of genetic risk within Parkinson's disease to date, to the best of our knowledge, by revealing many additional Parkinson's disease risk loci, providing a biological context for these risk factors, and showing that a considerable genetic component of this disease remains unidentified. These associations derived from European ancestry datasets will need to be followed-up with more diverse data.

We found 75 risk loci, of which 42 were new at the time of analysis. Pathway enrichment analyses confirmed the involvement of amyloid/tau pathways and highlighted microglia implication. Gene prioritization in the new loci identified 31 genes that were suggestive of new genetically associated processes, including the tumor necrosis factor alpha pathway through the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex. We also built a new genetic risk score associated with the risk of future AD/dementia or progression from mild cognitive impairment to AD/dementia. The improvement in prediction led to a 1.6- to 1.9-fold increase in AD risk from the lowest to the highest decile, in addition to effects of age and the APOE ε4 allele.},

The timing of onset shows no significant association with HTT cis-eQTLs but is influenced, sometimes in a sex-specific manner, by polymorphic variation at multiple DNA maintenance genes, suggesting that the special onset-determining property of the uninterrupted CAG repeat is a propensity for length instability that leads to its somatic expansion. Additional naturally occurring genetic modifier loci, defined by GWAS, may influence HD pathogenesis through other mechanisms. These findings have profound implications for the pathogenesis of HD and other repeat diseases and question the fundamental premise that polyglutamine length determines the rate of pathogenesis in the "polyglutamine disorders."},

	abstract = {Huntington's disease (HD), also known as Huntington's chorea, is a neurodegenerative disease that is mostly inherited. The earliest symptoms are often subtle problems with mood or mental abilities. A general lack of coordination and an unsteady gait often follow. It is also a basal ganglia disease causing a hyperkinetic movement disorder known as chorea. As the disease advances, uncoordinated, involuntary body movements of chorea become more apparent. Physical abilities gradually worsen until coordinated movement becomes difficult and the person is unable to talk. Mental abilities generally decline into dementia. The specific symptoms vary somewhat between people. Symptoms usually begin between 30 and 50 years of age but can start at any age. The disease may develop earlier in each successive generation. About eight percent of cases start before the age of 20 years, and are known as juvenile HD, which typically present with the slow movement symptoms of Parkinson's disease rather than those of chorea.HD is typically inherited from an affected parent, who carries a mutation in the huntingtin gene (HTT). However, up to 10\% of cases are due to a new mutation. The huntingtin gene provides the genetic information for huntingtin protein (Htt). Expansion of CAG repeats of cytosine-adenine-guanine (known as a trinucleotide repeat expansion) in the gene coding for the huntingtin protein results in an abnormal mutant protein (mHtt), which gradually damages brain cells through a number of possible mechanisms. Diagnosis is by genetic testing, which can be carried out at any time, regardless of whether or not symptoms are present. This fact raises several ethical debates: the age at which an individual is considered mature enough to choose testing; whether parents have the right to have their children tested; and managing confidentiality and disclosure of test results.No cure for HD is known, and full-time care is required in the later stages. Treatments can relieve some symptoms, and in some, improve quality of life. The best evidence for treatment of the movement problems is with tetrabenazine. HD affects about 4 to 15 in 100,000 people of European descent. It is rare among Japanese, while the occurrence rate in Africa is unknown. The disease affects men and women equally. Complications such as pneumonia, heart disease, and physical injury from falls reduce life expectancy. Suicide is the cause of death in about 9\% of cases. Death typically occurs 15–20 years from when the disease was first detected.The earliest known description of the disease was in 1841 by American physician Charles Oscar Waters. The condition was described in further detail in 1872 by American physician George Huntington. The genetic basis was discovered in 1993 by an international collaborative effort led by the Hereditary Disease Foundation. Research and support organizations began forming in the late 1960s to increase public awareness, provide support for individuals and their families and promote research. Research directions include determining the exact mechanism of the disease, improving animal models to aid with research, testing of medications and their delivery to treat symptoms or slow the progression of the disease, and studying procedures such as stem-cell therapy with the goal of replacing damaged or lost neurons.},

	abstract = {Schizophrenia has a heritability of 60–80\%1, much of which is attributable to common risk alleles. Here, in a two-stage genome-wide association study of up to 76,755 individuals with schizophrenia and 243,649 control individuals, we report common variant associations at 287 distinct genomic loci. Associations were concentrated in genes that are expressed in excitatory and inhibitory neurons of the central nervous system, but not in other tissues or cell types. Using fine-mapping and functional genomic data, we identify 120 genes (106 protein-coding) that are likely to underpin associations at some of these loci, including 16 genes with credible causal non-synonymous or untranslated region variation. We also implicate fundamental processes related to neuronal function, including synaptic organization, differentiation and transmission. Fine-mapped candidates were enriched for genes associated with rare disruptive coding variants in people with schizophrenia, including the glutamate receptor subunit GRIN2A and transcription factor SP4, and were also enriched for genes implicated by such variants in neurodevelopmental disorders. We identify biological processes relevant to schizophrenia pathophysiology; show convergence of common and rare variant associations in schizophrenia and neurodevelopmental disorders; and provide a resource of prioritized genes and variants to advance mechanistic studies.},

The length of the triplet repeat is the most important factor in determining age of onset of HD, although substantial variability remains after controlling for repeat length. The Venezuelan HD kindreds encompass 18,149 individuals spanning 10 generations, 15,409 of whom are living. Of the 4,384 immortalized lymphocyte lines collected, 3,989 DNAs were genotyped for their HD alleles, representing a subset of the population at greatest genetic risk. There are 938 heterozygotes, 80 people with variably penetrant alleles, and 18 homozygotes. Analysis of the 83 kindreds that comprise the Venezuelan HD kindreds demonstrates that residual variability in age of onset has both genetic and environmental components. We created a residual age of onset phenotype from a regression analysis of the log of age of onset on repeat length. Familial correlations (correlation +/- SE) were estimated for sibling (0.40 +/- 0.09), parent-offspring (0.10 +/- 0.11), avuncular (0.07 +/- 0.11), and cousin (0.15 +/- 0.10) pairs, suggesting a familial origin for the residual variance in onset. By using a variance-components approach with all available familial relationships, the additive genetic heritability of this residual age of onset trait is 38\%. A model, including shared sibling environmental effects, estimated the components of additive genetic (0.37), shared environment (0.22), and nonshared environment (0.41) variances, confirming that approximately 40\% of the variance remaining in onset age is attributable to genes other than the HD gene and 60\% is environmental.},

Both nicotinic and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors are decreased in AD, and it has been shown that the reduction in the number of acetylcholine receptors precedes other pathologic changes. Anti-cholinergic drugs induce amnesia, which can be reversed by withdrawal of the medication. Inhibition of the down-regulation of acetylcholine is, therefore, a strategy for the treatment of AD because it could augment acetylcholine levels within synaptic clefts. In this context, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, which improve cognitive functions, are currently approved for the treatment of AD. Stimulation of acetylcholine receptors, nicotinic or muscarinic, is another strategy; some drugs are currently under investigation, and reported to be effective. In addition, nicotinic stimulation exerts a neuroprotective effect, and reduces the amyloid burden. Cholinergic therapy may counter the symptoms and progress of AD.},

Albeit CYP2D6 gene is not present in rodents, its orthologs perform almost the similar function with imprecise substrate and inhibitor specificity. CYP2D6 expression and catalytic activity are found to be regulated at every stage of the central dogma except replication as well as at the epigenetic level. CYP2D6 gene codes for a set of alternate splice variants that give rise to a range of enzymes possessing variable catalytic activity. Case-control studies, meta-analysis and systemic reviews covering CYP2D6 polymorphism and PD risk have demonstrated that poor metabolizer phenotype possesses a considerable genetic susceptibility. Besides, ultra-rapid metabolizer offers protection against the risk in some populations while lack of positive or inverse association is also reported in other inhabitants. CYP2D6 polymorphisms resulting into deviant protein products with differing catalytic activity could lead to inter-individual variations, which could be explained to certain extent on the basis of sample size, life style factors, food habits, ethnicity and tools used for statistical analysis across various studies. Current article describes the role played by polymorphic CYP2D6 in the metabolism of anti-PD drugs/Parkinsonian toxins and how polymorphisms determine PD risk or protection. Moreover, CYP2D6 orthologs and their roles in rodent models of Parkinsonism have also been mentioned. Finally, a perspective on inconsistency in the findings and futuristic relevance of CYP2D6 polymorphisms in disease diagnosis and treatment has also been highlighted.},

	abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder for which environmental factors influence disease risk and may act via an epigenetic mechanism. The microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) is a susceptibility gene for idiopathic PD. Methylation levels were determined by pyrosequencing of bisulfite-treated DNA in a leukocyte cohort (358 PD patients and 1084 controls) and in two brain cohorts (Brain1, comprising 69 cerebellum controls; and Brain2, comprising 3 brain regions from 28 PD patients and 12 controls). In vitro assays involved the transfection of methylated promoter-luciferase constructs or treatment with an exogenous micronutrient. In normal leukocytes, the MAPT H1/H2 diplotype and sex were predictors of MAPT methylation. Haplotype-specific pyrosequencing confirmed that the H1 haplotype had higher methylation than the H2 haplotype in normal leukocytes and brain tissues. MAPT methylation was negatively associated with MAPT expression in the Brain1 cohort and in transfected cells. Methylation levels differed between three normal brain regions (Brain2 cohort, putamen {\textless} cerebellum {\textless} anterior cingulate cortex). In PD samples, age at onset was positively associated with MAPT methylation in leukocytes. Moreover, there was hypermethylation in the cerebellum and hypomethylation in the putamen of PD patients compared with controls (Brain2 cohort). Finally, leukocyte methylation status was positively associated with blood vitamin E levels, and the effect was more significant in H2 haplotype carriers; this result was confirmed in cells that were exposed to 100 μM vitamin E. The significant effects of sex, diplotype, and brain region suggest that hypermethylation of the MAPT gene is neuroprotective by reducing MAPT expression. The effect of vitamin E on MAPT represents a possible gene-environment interaction.},

	abstract = {Epidemiological and clinical studies have suggested comorbidity between schizophrenia and several neurodegenerative disorders. However, little is known whether there exists shared genetic architecture. To explore their relationship from a genetic and transcriptomic perspective, we applied polygenic and linkage disequilibrium-informed methods to examine the genetic correlation between schizophrenia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease and frontotemporal dementia. We further combined genome-wide association summary statistics with large-scale transcriptomic datasets, to identify putative shared genes and explore related pathological tissues. We identified positive and significant correlation between schizophrenia and ALS at genetic (correlation 0.22; 95\% CI: 0.16–0.28; p = 4.00E-04) and transcriptomic (correlation 0.08; 95\% CI: 0.04–0.11; p = 0.034) levels. We further demonstrated that schizophrenia- and ALS-inferred gene expression overlap significantly in four tissues including skin, small intestine, brain cortex and lung, and highlighted three genes, namely GLB1L3, ZNHIT3 and TMEM194A as potential mediators of the correlation between schizophrenia and ALS. Our findings revealed overlapped gene expression profiles in specific tissues between schizophrenia and ALS, and identified novel potential shared genes. These results provided a better understanding for the pleiotropy of schizophrenia, and paved way for future studies to further elucidate the molecular drivers of schizophrenia.},

	abstract = {Purpose of the ReviewNowadays, the incidence of schizophrenia is noticeably increased. If left undiagnosed and untreated, it will lead to impaired social functions, repeated hospital admissions, decline in quality of life and life expectancy. However, the diagnosis of schizophrenia is complicated and challenging. Both genetic and environmental factors are considered as important contributors to the development and progression of this disorder. The environmental factors have been linked to changes in gene expression through epigenetic modulations, which have raised more and more research interests in recent years. This review article is to summarize the current findings and understanding of epigenetic modulation associated with pathogenesis of schizophrenia, aiming to provide useful information for further research in developing biomarkers for schizophrenia.Recent FindingsThree major types of epigenetic modulations have been described in this article. Firstly, both DNA hypermethylation and hypomethylated have been associated with schizophrenia via analyzing post-mortem brain tissues and peripheral blood of patients. Specific changes of non-coding RNAs, particularly microRNAs and long-chain non-coding RNAs, have been observed in central and peripheral samples of schizophrenia patients, indicating their significant diagnostic value for the disease, and may also potentially predict treatment response. The correlation between histone modification and schizophrenia, however, is largely unclear.SummaryEpigenetic modulations, including DNA methylation, ncRNA transcriptional regulation and histone modification, play an important role in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Therefore, tests of these epigenetic alterations may be utilized to assist in the diagnosis and determination of strategies of individualized treatment in clinical practice.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) abnormalities have been implicated in bipolar disorder. However, due to discrepant studies measuring postmortem, cerebrospinal fluid, plasma, and in vivo brain levels of GABA, the nature of these abnormalities is unclear. Using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we investigated tissue levels of GABA in the anterior cingulate cortex and parieto-occipital cortex of participants with bipolar disorder and healthy controls.
METHODS: Fourteen stably medicated euthymic outpatients with bipolar disorder type I (mean age 32.6 years, eight male) and 14 healthy control participants (mean age 36.9 years, 10 male) completed a proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy scan at 4-Tesla after providing informed consent. We collected data from two 16.7-mL voxels using MEGAPRESS, and they were analyzed using LCModel.
RESULTS: GABA/creatine ratios were elevated in bipolar disorder participants compared to healthy controls [F(1,21) = 4.4, p = 0.048] in the anterior cingulate cortex (25.1\% elevation) and the parieto-occipital cortex (14.6\% elevation). Bipolar disorder participants not taking GABA-modulating medications demonstrated greater GABA/creatine elevations than patients taking GABA-modulating medications.
CONCLUSIONS: We found higher GABA/creatine levels in euthymic bipolar disorder outpatients compared to healthy controls, and the extent of this elevation may be affected by the use of GABA-modulating medications. Our findings suggest that elevated brain GABA levels in bipolar disorder may be associated with GABAergic dysfunction and that GABA-modulating medications reduce GABA levels in this condition.},

              The serotonin hypothesis of depression is still influential. We aimed to synthesise and evaluate evidence on whether depression is associated with lowered serotonin concentration or activity in a systematic umbrella review of the principal relevant areas of research. PubMed, EMBASE and PsycINFO were searched using terms appropriate to each area of research, from their inception until December 2020. Systematic reviews, meta-analyses and large data-set analyses in the following areas were identified: serotonin and serotonin metabolite, 5-HIAA, concentrations in body fluids; serotonin 5-HT

              receptor binding; serotonin transporter (SERT) levels measured by imaging or at post-mortem; tryptophan depletion studies; SERT gene associations and SERT gene-environment interactions. Studies of depression associated with physical conditions and specific subtypes of depression (e.g. bipolar depression) were excluded. Two independent reviewers extracted the data and assessed the quality of included studies using the AMSTAR-2, an adapted AMSTAR-2, or the STREGA for a large genetic study. The certainty of study results was assessed using a modified version of the GRADE. We did not synthesise results of individual meta-analyses because they included overlapping studies. The review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020207203). 17 studies were included: 12 systematic reviews and meta-analyses, 1 collaborative meta-analysis, 1 meta-analysis of large cohort studies, 1 systematic review and narrative synthesis, 1 genetic association study and 1 umbrella review. Quality of reviews was variable with some genetic studies of high quality. Two meta-analyses of overlapping studies examining the serotonin metabolite, 5-HIAA, showed no association with depression (largest

               = 1869). Two meta-analyses of overlapping studies examining the 5-HT
              1A
              receptor (largest
              n
               = 561), and three meta-analyses of overlapping studies examining SERT binding (largest
              n
               = 1845) showed weak and inconsistent evidence of reduced binding in some areas, which would be consistent with increased synaptic availability of serotonin in people with depression, if this was the original, causal abnormaly. However, effects of prior antidepressant use were not reliably excluded. One meta-analysis of tryptophan depletion studies found no effect in most healthy volunteers (
              n
               = 566), but weak evidence of an effect in those with a family history of depression (
              n
               = 75). Another systematic review (
              n
               = 342) and a sample of ten subsequent studies (
              n
               = 407) found no effect in volunteers. No systematic review of tryptophan depletion studies has been performed since 2007. The two largest and highest quality studies of the SERT gene, one genetic association study (
              n
               = 115,257) and one collaborative meta-analysis (
              n
               = 43,165), revealed no evidence of an association with depression, or of an interaction between genotype, stress and depression. The main areas of serotonin research provide no consistent evidence of there being an association between serotonin and depression, and no support for the hypothesis that depression is caused by lowered serotonin activity or concentrations. Some evidence was consistent with the possibility that long-term antidepressant use reduces serotonin concentration.},

Through the past several decades, approaches undertaken to clarify the roles of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin in depression have included animal studies, human biological and postmortem studies, inferences drawn from antidepressant drug actions, and challenge or depletion studies; most recently, brain imaging studies have proved to be especially informative. This research has identified novel potential targets, with the goal of developing new antidepressant drugs with better efficacy and faster onset of action than current "gold-standard" treatments.},

Results of different studies also support a role of the dopaminergic system in depression: In particular, psychomotor retarded depressive patients exhibited lower levels of homovanillic acid (metabolite of dopamine). While the moodimproving effect of methylphenidat, D-amphetamine and cocaine is also supportive for an involvement of the dopaminergic system, reserpine leads to diminished dopamine levels and may induce a depressive syndrome as well as dopamine receptor-blockers. Dopamine-mediated motor disturbances and accompanying changes in mood in Parkinson's disease likewise support pathophysiological similarities of depression and Parkinson's disease. Psychomotor inhibition, reduced facial expression and decreased speech production in depression are in line with a hypodopaminergic state of the respective motor areas. There is evidence from open studies for the ergotalkaloids bromocriptine and pergolide to have anti-depressive effects. Controlled studies for the selective dopamine D2/D3-agonists pramipexole and ropinirole are existing.

This provides an exciting opportunity to advance therapeutic development in HD, as these pathways have already been under intense investigation in cancer research. Also emerging are the roles of other polyglutamine disease proteins in DNA damage repair mechanisms. A potential universal trigger of oxidative DNA damage shared in these late age-onset diseases is the increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in human aging, defining an age-related mechanism that has defied other hypotheses of neurodegeneration. We discuss the potential commonality of DNA damage repair pathways in HD and other neurodegenerative diseases. Potential targets for therapy that may prove beneficial across many of these diseases are also identified, defining nodes in the ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) complex, mismatch repair, and poly ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs).},

The inferred disease enrichments recapitulated known biology and highlighted notable cell–disease relationships, including γ-aminobutyric acid-ergic neurons in major depressive disorder, a disease-dependent M-cell program in ulcerative colitis and a disease-specific complement cascade process in multiple sclerosis. In autoimmune disease, both healthy and disease-dependent immune cell-type programs were associated, whereas only disease-dependent epithelial cell programs were prominent, suggesting a role in disease response rather than initiation.

Genetically poor CYP2D6 metabolizers are at higher risk for developing Parkinson's disease (PD), a risk that increases with exposure to pesticides. As age is a risk factor for PD we measured the ontogenic expression of CYP2D6 in human brain, and compared brain CYP2D6 levels in PD cases with age-matched controls. CYP2D6 increased from fetal to 80 years of age (n = 76), exhibiting 3 distinct phases of change. Compared with PD controls, PD cases had approximately 40\% lower CYP2D6 levels in the frontal cortex, cerebellum, and the hippocampus, even when controlling for CYP2D6 genotype. In contrast, CYP2D6 levels in cases were similar to controls in PD-affected brain areas, the substantia nigra, and caudate, consistent with higher astrocytic and cellular CYP2D6 staining observed in PD cases. In summary, the lower CYP2D6 levels in PD cases may have reduced their ability to inactivate PD-causing neurotoxins contributing to their disease risk.},

In line with the enhancement of MPTP toxicity by diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC), here we demonstrate how other CYP450 (2E1) inhibitors, such as diallyl sulfide (DAS) or phenylethylisothiocyanate (PIC), also potentiate the selective DA neuron degeneration in C57/bl mice. In order to provide direct evidence for this isozyme involvement, CYP 2E1 knockout mice were challenged with MPTP or the combined treatment. Here we show that these transgenic mice have a low sensitivity to MPTP alone, similarly to the wild type SVI, suggesting that it is likely that transgenic mice compensate for the missing enzyme. However, in these CYP 2E1 knockout mice, DDC pretreatment completely fails to enhance MPTP toxicity; this enhancement is instead regularly present in the SVI control animals. This study indicates that the occurrence of CYP 2E1 in C57/bl mouse brain is relevant for MPTP toxicity, and suggests that this isozyme may have a detoxificant role related to the efflux transporter of the toxin.},

Albeit CYP2D6 gene is not present in rodents, its orthologs perform almost the similar function with imprecise substrate and inhibitor specificity. CYP2D6 expression and catalytic activity are found to be regulated at every stage of the central dogma except replication as well as at the epigenetic level. CYP2D6 gene codes for a set of alternate splice variants that give rise to a range of enzymes possessing variable catalytic activity. Case-control studies, meta-analysis and systemic reviews covering CYP2D6 polymorphism and PD risk have demonstrated that poor metabolizer phenotype possesses a considerable genetic susceptibility. Besides, ultra-rapid metabolizer offers protection against the risk in some populations while lack of positive or inverse association is also reported in other inhabitants. CYP2D6 polymorphisms resulting into deviant protein products with differing catalytic activity could lead to inter-individual variations, which could be explained to certain extent on the basis of sample size, life style factors, food habits, ethnicity and tools used for statistical analysis across various studies. Current article describes the role played by polymorphic CYP2D6 in the metabolism of anti-PD drugs/Parkinsonian toxins and how polymorphisms determine PD risk or protection. Moreover, CYP2D6 orthologs and their roles in rodent models of Parkinsonism have also been mentioned.

Mutations in CYP2D6B are also not implicated in familial PD. As yet, there is no conclusive evidence to suggest that CYP2D6 polymorphisms confer susceptibility to PD.

Due to the continuous increase of data deposited in genomic repositories, their content revision and analysis is recommended. Using GeneBase, a software with a graphical interface able to import and elaborate National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene database entries, we provide tabulated spreadsheets updated to 2019 about human nuclear protein-coding gene data set ready to be used for any type of analysis about genes, transcripts and gene organization.
RESULTS: Comparison with previous reports reveals substantial change in the number of known nuclear protein-coding genes (now 19,116), the protein-coding non-redundant transcriptome space [now 59,281,518 base pair (bp), 10.1\% increase], the number of exons (now 562,164, 36.2\% increase) due to a relevant increase of the RNA isoforms recorded. Other parameters such as gene, exon or intron mean and extreme length appear to have reached a stability that is unlikely to be substantially modified by human genome data updates, at least regarding protein-coding genes. Finally, we confirm that there are no human introns shorter than 30 bp.},

We identified 17 top enriched genes with four genes (PCSK9, FAM177, LPL, ARGEF26), reaching statistical significance (p ≤ 3.0 × 10–6) using both GBA tests in two GWAS studies. In addition, our analyses identified ten genes (DUSP13, KCNJ11, CD300LF/RAB37, SLCO1B1, LRRFIP1, QSER1, UBR2, MOB3C, MST1R, and ABCC8) with previously unreported associations with CAD, although none of the single SNV associations within the genes were genome-wide significant.

	abstract = {Most human diseases are dichotomous and are measured on a binary scale (disease absent (0) or present (1)). Some of the observed phenotypic variation of disease can be attributed to genetic variation.Heritability is the ratio of the genetic variation to the phenotypic variation. Its estimates are specific to the population, disease and circumstances on which it is estimated.Methods to estimate heritability for continuous traits do not directly apply to disease, and heritability is often estimated on an assumed normally distributed liability that underlies disease. This is called the heritability of liability to disease (hx2) and should be distinguished from the heritability of disease in the observed scale or disease itself (h0/12).Methods of estimation based on mixed linear models have the ability to exploit data composed of various relatives and are the recommended methods of estimation in practice.Difficulties of estimation, potential biases and a lack of consistent interpretation have made heritability a controversial summary statistic of familial aggregation of disease.Despite its caveats, heritability is the single most useful measure of familial aggregation of disease. The heritability captures information from multiple relatives and can be interpreted in a wider context than competing measures such as the sibling relative risk, which is useful only in the context of siblings. Moreover, unlike other measures of familial aggregation, it attempts to separate environmental and genetic sources of familial correlation.The main sources of bias in heritability estimates are common environmental factors, genotype-by-environment interactions, disease diagnosis and ascertainment andthe change of scale from the observed to the liability scale when h0/12 is estimated.Heritability estimates are useful because they set limits to the contribution of genetic factors to variation of disease; however, identifying genetic and environmental sources of familial covariance should remain the primary aim of future research.},

Psychiatric disorders include, but are not limited to, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, anxiety disorders, major depressive disorder, and attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder. Several risk loci for psychiatric disorders fall within genes that encode for voltage-gated calcium channels (CaVs). Calcium entering through CaVs is crucial for multiple neuronal processes. In this review, we will summarize recent findings that link CaVs and their auxiliary subunits to psychiatric disorders. First, we will provide a general overview of CaVs structure, classification, function, expression and pharmacology. Next, we will summarize tools to study risk loci associated with psychiatric disorders. We will examine functional studies of risk variations in CaV genes when available. Finally, we will review pharmacological evidence of the use of CaV modulators to treat psychiatric disorders. Our review will be of interest for those studying pathophysiological aspects of CaVs.},

This review of the work of the group based initially at the University of Birmingham into the functional genomics of XMEs and neurodegenerative diseases has indicated that: 1. Sub-groups of patients with PD and MND can be identified with problems in xenobiotic metabolism by in vivo or in vitro methods. 2. 38-39\% of the patients with MND/PD have a defect in the S-oxidation of the mucoactive drug, carbocysteine, by an unknown cytosolic oxidase(s). The odds risk ratio for the association of this defect with these diseases was calculated to be 10.21 for MND and 10.50 for PD. 3. Patients with PD appear to have an altered substrate specificity for monoamine oxidase B substrates in an in vitro platelet assay. 4. Patients with MND have an increased capacity to S-methylate aliphatic sulphydryl compounds in an in vivo challenge as well as an in vitro erythrocyte thiol methyltransferase assay. The results of over a decade of investigations into both PD and MND indicate that these are diseases with mutifactorial origins that encompass both genetic predisposition and environmental insult.},

Xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes, important for the metabolism, elimination and detoxification of exogenous agents, are found in most tissues and organs and are distinguished into phase I and phase II enzymes, as well as phase III transporters. The cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes plays a major role in the biotransformation of most xenobiotics as well as in the metabolism of important endogenous substrates such as steroids and fatty acids. The activity and the potential toxicity of numerous drugs are strongly influenced by their biotransformation, mainly accomplished by the cytochrome P450 enzymes, one of the most versatile enzyme systems.
OBJECTIVE: In this review, considering the importance of drug metabolising enzymes in health and disease, some of our previous research results are presented, which, combined with newer findings, may assist in the elucidation of xenobiotic metabolism and in the development of more efficient drugs.
CONCLUSION: Study of drug metabolism is of major importance for the development of drugs and provides insight into the control of human health.

	abstract = {Huntington’s disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disease caused by an expanded CAG repeat in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. CAG repeat length explains around half of the variation in age at onset (AAO) but genetic variation elsewhere in the genome accounts for a significant proportion of the remainder. Genome-wide association studies have identified a bidirectional signal on chromosome 15, likely underlain by FANCD2- and FANCI-associated nuclease 1 (FAN1), a nuclease involved in DNA interstrand cross link repair. Here we show that increased FAN1 expression is significantly associated with delayed AAO and slower progression of HD, suggesting FAN1 is protective in the context of an expanded HTT CAG repeat. FAN1 overexpression in human cells reduces CAG repeat expansion in exogenously expressed mutant HTT exon 1, and in patient-derived stem cells and differentiated medium spiny neurons, FAN1 knockdown increases CAG repeat expansion. The stabilizing effects are FAN1 concentration and CAG repeat length-dependent. We show that FAN1 binds to the expanded HTT CAG repeat DNA and its nuclease activity is not required for protection against CAG repeat expansion. These data shed new mechanistic insights into how the genetic modifiers of HD act to alter disease progression and show that FAN1 affects somatic expansion of the CAG repeat through a nuclease-independent mechanism. This provides new avenues for therapeutic interventions in HD and potentially other triplet repeat disorders.},

	abstract = {Objective The polyglutamine diseases, including Huntington's disease (HD) and multiple spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), are among the commonest hereditary neurodegenerative diseases. They are caused by expanded CAG tracts, encoding glutamine, in different genes. Longer CAG repeat tracts are associated with earlier ages at onset, but this does not account for all of the difference, and the existence of additional genetic modifying factors has been suggested in these diseases. A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) in HD found association between age at onset and genetic variants in DNA repair pathways, and we therefore tested whether the modifying effects of variants in DNA repair genes have wider effects in the polyglutamine diseases. Methods We assembled an independent cohort of 1,462 subjects with HD and polyglutamine SCAs, and genotyped single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) selected from the most significant hits in the HD study. Results In the analysis of DNA repair genes as a group, we found the most significant association with age at onset when grouping all polyglutamine diseases (HD+SCAs; p = 1.43 × 10–5). In individual SNP analysis, we found significant associations for rs3512 in FAN1 with HD+SCAs (p = 1.52 × 10–5) and all SCAs (p = 2.22 × 10–4) and rs1805323 in PMS2 with HD+SCAs (p = 3.14 × 10–5), all in the same direction as in the HD GWAS. Interpretation We show that DNA repair genes significantly modify age at onset in HD and SCAs, suggesting a common pathogenic mechanism, which could operate through the observed somatic expansion of repeats that can be modulated by genetic manipulation of DNA repair in disease models. This offers novel therapeutic opportunities in multiple diseases. Ann Neurol 2016;79:983–990},

Its mode of action has been linked to its ability to crosslink with the purine bases on the DNA; interfering with DNA repair mechanisms, causing DNA damage, and subsequently inducing apoptosis in cancer cells. However, because of drug resistance and numerous undesirable side effects such as severe kidney problems, allergic reactions, decrease immunity to infections, gastrointestinal disorders, hemorrhage, and hearing loss especially in younger patients, other platinum-containing anti-cancer drugs such as carboplatin, oxaliplatin and others, have also been used. Furthermore, combination therapies of cisplatin with other drugs have been highly considered to overcome drug-resistance and reduce toxicity. This comprehensive review highlights the physicochemical properties of cisplatin and related platinum-based drugs, and discusses its uses (either alone or in combination with other drugs) for the treatment of various human cancers. A special attention is given to its molecular mechanisms of action, and its undesirable side effects.},

	abstract = {Drug repurposing is promoted as a cost- and time-effective mechanism for providing new medicines. Often, however, there is insufficient consideration by academic researchers of the processes required to ensure that a repurposed drug can be used for a new indication. This may explain the inability of drug repurposing to fulfill its promise. Important aspects, often overlooked, include financial and intellectual property considerations, the clinical and regulatory path, and clinical equipoise, which provides ethical justification for randomized controlled trials. The goal of drug repurposing is to obtain a new regulator-approved label for an existing drug, and so, the trajectory for drug repurposing and traditional drug development is similar. Here, we discuss factors critical for a successful repurposed medicine to help academic investigators better identify drug repurposing opportunities.},

In our method, we integrate: (1) a dataset of transcriptome  responses of a cell line to a panel of drugs; (2) two sets of genes for the  disease; and (3) mappings between drugs and the receptors or pathways that they  target. We carried out a gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) test for each of the  two gene sets against a list of genes ordered by fold-change in response to a  drug in a relevant cell line (HL60), with the overall score for a drug being the  difference of the two enrichment scores. Next, we applied GSEA for drug targets  based on drugs that have been ranked by their differential enrichment scores. The  method ranks drugs by the degree of anti-correlation of their gene-level  transcriptional effects on the cell line with the genes in the disease gene sets.  We applied the method to data from (1) CMap 2.0; (2) gene sets from two  transcriptome profiling studies of atherosclerosis; and (3) a combined dataset of  drug/target information. Our analysis recapitulated known targets related to CVD  (e.g., PPARγ; HMG-CoA reductase, HDACs) and novel targets (e.g., amine oxidase A,  δ-opioid receptor). We conclude that combining disease-associated gene sets,  drug-transcriptome-responses datasets and drug-target annotations can potentially  be useful as a screening tool for diseases that lack an accepted cellular model  for in vitro screening.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed a large number of links between genome variation and complex disease. Among other benefits, it is expected that these insights will lead to new therapeutic strategies, particularly the identification of new drug targets. In this paper, we evaluate the power of GWAS studies to find drug targets by examining how many existing drug targets have been directly 'rediscovered' by this technique, and the extent to which GWAS results may be leveraged by network information to discover known and new drug targets.
RESULTS: We find that only a very small fraction of drug targets are directly detected in the relevant GWAS studies. We investigate two possible explanations for this observation. First, we find evidence of negative selection acting on drug target genes as a consequence of strong coupling with the disease phenotype, so reducing the incidence of SNPs linked to the disease. Second, we find that GWAS genes are substantially longer on average than drug targets and than all genes, suggesting there is a length related bias in GWAS results. In spite of the low direct relationship between drug targets and GWAS reported genes, we found these two sets of genes are closely coupled in the human protein network. As a consequence, machine-learning methods are able to recover known drug targets based on network context and the set of GWAS reported genes for the same disease. We show the approach is potentially useful for identifying drug repurposing opportunities.
CONCLUSIONS: Although GWA studies do not directly identify most existing drug targets, there are several reasons to expect that new targets will nevertheless be discovered using these data. Initial results on drug repurposing studies using network analysis are encouraging and suggest directions for future development.},

	abstract = {The replication crisis (also called the replicability crisis and the reproducibility crisis) is an ongoing methodological crisis in which the results of many scientific studies are difficult or impossible to reproduce. Because the reproducibility of empirical results is an essential part of the scientific method, such failures undermine the credibility of theories building on them and potentially call into question substantial parts of scientific knowledge.
The replication crisis is frequently discussed in relation to psychology and medicine, where considerable efforts have been undertaken to reinvestigate classic results, to determine whether they are reliable, and if they turn out not to be, the reasons for the failure. Data strongly indicates that other natural and social sciences are affected as well.The phrase replication crisis was coined in the early 2010s as part of a growing awareness of the problem. Considerations of causes and remedies have given rise to a new scientific discipline, metascience, which uses methods of empirical research to examine empirical research practice.
Considerations about reproducibility fall into two categories. Reproducibility in the narrow sense refers to re-examining and validating the analysis of a given set of data. Replication refers to repeating the experiment or study to obtain new, independent data with the goal of reaching the same or similar conclusions.},

	abstract = {Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of complex traits have yielded more reproducible associations than had been discovered using any other approach, the loci characterized to date do not account for much of the heritability to such traits and, in general, have not led to improved understanding of the biology underlying complex phenotypes. Using a web site we developed to serve results of expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies in lymphoblastoid cell lines from HapMap samples (http://www.scandb.org), we show that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with complex traits (from http://www.genome.gov/gwastudies/) are significantly more likely to be eQTLs than minor-allele-frequency–matched SNPs chosen from high-throughput GWAS platforms. These findings are robust across a range of thresholds for establishing eQTLs (p-values from 10−4–10−8), and a broad spectrum of human complex traits. Analyses of GWAS data from the Wellcome Trust studies confirm that annotating SNPs with a score reflecting the strength of the evidence that the SNP is an eQTL can improve the ability to discover true associations and clarify the nature of the mechanism driving the associations. Our results showing that trait-associated SNPs are more likely to be eQTLs and that application of this information can enhance discovery of trait-associated SNPs for complex phenotypes raise the possibility that we can utilize this information both to increase the heritability explained by identifiable genetic factors and to gain a better understanding of the biology underlying complex traits.},

Here we introduce a new set of functional annotations based on causal posterior probabilities of fine-mapped molecular cis-QTLs, using data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) and BLUEPRINT consortia. We show that these annotations are more strongly enriched for heritability (5.84× for eQTLs; P = 1.19 × 10−31) across 41 diseases and complex traits than annotations containing all significant molecular QTLs (1.80× for expression (e)QTLs). eQTL annotations obtained by meta-analyzing all GTEx tissues generally performed best, whereas tissue-specific eQTL annotations produced stronger enrichments for blood- and brain-related diseases and traits. eQTL annotations restricted to loss-of-function intolerant genes were even more enriched for heritability (17.06×; P = 1.20 × 10−35). All molecular QTLs except splicing QTLs remained significantly enriched in joint analysis, indicating that each of these annotations is uniquely informative for disease and complex trait architectures.},

RESULTS: We  detail our dpGSEA method and show its effectiveness in detecting specific  perturbation of drugs in independent public datasets by confirming fluvastatin,  paclitaxel, and rosiglitazone perturbation in gastroenteropancreatic  neuroendocrine tumor cells. In drug discovery experiments, we found that dpGSEA  was able to detect phenotypically relevant drug targets in previously published  differentially expressed genes of CD4+T regulatory cells from immune responders  and non-responders to antiviral therapy in HIV-infected individuals, such as  those involved with virion replication, cell cycle dysfunction, and mitochondrial  dysfunction. dpGSEA is publicly available at  https://github.com/sxf296/drug\_targeting . CONCLUSIONS: dpGSEA is an approach  that uniquely enriches on drug-defined gene sets while considering directionality  of gene modulation.

	abstract = {Epilepsy is a severe neurological condition affecting 50-65 million individuals worldwide that can lead to brain damage. Nevertheless, the etiology of epilepsy  remains poorly understood. Meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies  involving 15,212 epilepsy cases and 29,677 controls of the ILAE Consortium cohort  were used to conduct transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) and  protein-wide association studies (PWAS). Furthermore, a protein-protein  interaction (PPI) network was generated using the STRING database, and  significant epilepsy-susceptible genes were verified using chip data.  Chemical-related gene set enrichment analysis (CGSEA) was performed to determine  novel drug targets for epilepsy. TWAS analysis identified 21,170 genes, of which  58 were significant (TWAS(fdr) {\textless} 0.05) in ten brain regions, and 16  differentially expressed genes were verified based on mRNA expression profiles.  The PWAS identified 2249 genes, of which 2 were significant (PWAS(fdr) {\textless} 0.05).  Through chemical-gene set enrichment analysis, 287 environmental chemicals  associated with epilepsy were identified. We identified five significant genes  (WIPF1, IQSEC1, JAM2, ICAM3, and ZNF143) that had causal relationships with  epilepsy. CGSEA identified 159 chemicals that were significantly correlated with  epilepsy (P(cgsea) {\textless} 0.05), such as pentobarbital, ketone bodies, and  polychlorinated biphenyl. In summary, we performed TWAS, PWAS (for genetic  factors), and CGSEA (for environmental factors) analyses and identified several  epilepsy-associated genes and chemicals. The results of this study will  contribute to our understanding of genetic and environmental factors for epilepsy  and may predict novel drug targets.},

	abstract = {The novelty of new human coronavirus COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 and the lack of effective drugs and vaccines gave rise to a wide variety of strategies employed  to fight this worldwide pandemic. Many of these strategies rely on the  repositioning of existing drugs that could shorten the time and reduce the cost  compared to de novo drug discovery. In this study, we presented a new  network-based algorithm for drug repositioning, called SAveRUNNER (Searching  off-lAbel dRUg aNd NEtwoRk), which predicts drug-disease associations by  quantifying the interplay between the drug targets and the disease-specific  proteins in the human interactome via a novel network-based similarity measure  that prioritizes associations between drugs and diseases locating in the same  network neighborhoods. Specifically, we applied SAveRUNNER on a panel of 14  selected diseases with a consolidated knowledge about their disease-causing genes  and that have been found to be related to COVID-19 for genetic similarity (i.e.,  SARS), comorbidity (e.g., cardiovascular diseases), or for their association to  drugs tentatively repurposed to treat COVID-19 (e.g., malaria, HIV, rheumatoid  arthritis). Focusing specifically on SARS subnetwork, we identified 282  repurposable drugs, including some the most rumored off-label drugs for COVID-19  treatments (e.g., chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, heparin), as well  as a new combination therapy of 5 drugs (hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine,  lopinavir, ritonavir, remdesivir), actually used in clinical practice.  Furthermore, to maximize the efficiency of putative downstream validation  experiments, we prioritized 24 potential anti-SARS-CoV repurposable drugs based  on their network-based similarity values. These top-ranked drugs include  ACE-inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies (e.g., anti-IFNγ, anti-TNFα, anti-IL12,  anti-IL1β, anti-IL6), and thrombin inhibitors. Finally, our findings were  in-silico validated by performing a gene set enrichment analysis, which confirmed  that most of the network-predicted repurposable drugs may have a potential  treatment effect against human coronavirus infections.},

We prioritized  403 SAveRUNNER-predicted drugs according to decreasing values of network  similarity with ALS.

Furthermore, we strengthened the SAveRUNNER predictions by a gene  set enrichment analysis that confirmed modafinil as a drug with the highest score  among the 121 identified drugs with a score {\textgreater} 0.

We found an association between GDM/DM2 and the genes targeted by 11 drug  classes. In the EMR analysis, 6 drug classes were associated with changes in GTT.  Two classes were identified in both analyses.

	abstract = {The etiology of many human complex diseases or traits involves interactions between chemicals and genes that regulate important physiological processes. It has been well documented that chemicals can contribute to disease development through affecting gene expression in vivo. In this study, we developed a flexible tool CGSEA for scanning the candidate chemicals associated with complex diseases or traits. CGSEA only need genome-wide summary level data, such as transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) and mRNA expression profiles. CGSEA was applied to the GWAS summaries of attention deficiency/hyperactive disorder, (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and cervical cancer. CGSEA identified several significant chemicals, which have been demonstrated to be involved in the development or treatment of ADHD, ASD and cervical cancer. The CGSEA program and user manual are available at https://github.com/ChengSQXJTU/CGSEA.},

	abstract = {Low statistical power undermines the purpose of scientific research; it reduces the chance of detecting a true effect.Perhaps less intuitively, low power also reduces the likelihood that a statistically significant result reflects a true effect.Empirically, we estimate the median statistical power of studies in the neurosciences is between ∼8\% and ∼31\%.We discuss the consequences of such low statistical power, which include overestimates of effect size and low reproducibility of results.There are ethical dimensions to the problem of low power; unreliable research is inefficient and wasteful.Improving reproducibility in neuroscience is a key priority and requires attention to well-established, but often ignored, methodological principles.We discuss how problems associated with low power can be addressed by adopting current best-practice and make clear recommendations for how to achieve this.},

	abstract = {Schizophrenia is a debilitating psychiatric condition often associated with poor quality of life and decreased life expectancy. Lack of progress in improving treatment outcomes has been attributed to limited knowledge of the underlying biology, although large-scale genomic studies have begun to provide insights. We report a new genome-wide association study of schizophrenia (11,260 cases and 24,542 controls), and through meta-analysis with existing data we identify 50 novel associated loci and 145 loci in total. Through integrating genomic fine-mapping with brain expression and chromosome conformation data, we identify candidate causal genes within 33 loci. We also show for the first time that the common variant association signal is highly enriched among genes that are under strong selective pressures. These findings provide new insights into the biology and genetic architecture of schizophrenia, highlight the importance of mutation-intolerant genes and suggest a mechanism by which common risk variants persist in the population.},
