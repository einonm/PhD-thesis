# Completing this PhD journey has been a challenging, joyful and insightful experience. I am extremely grateful to have been guided and supported by such a talented and committed group of individuals and am very thankful that they had the confidence to let me embark on this project whilst also attempting to keep the lights blinking in the data centre.
#
# First and foremost, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my primary supervisor, Professor Nigel Williams for his wisdom, expertise and guidance. I would also like to extend my appreciation to my three other supervisors, Professor Sir Michael Owen for his forward thinking, direction and keen intellect, Professor Peter Holmans for his invaluable experience in pulling my statistical and results presentation in to shape, and last but not least, I am truly appreciative of the time the late Professor Lesley Jones gave to provide her down to earth approach and attention to detail in my supervision. Lesley's passing last year was a great loss to Huntington's research, our academic community and our lives.
#
# I would like to thank several colleagues in particular for helpful specialist advice, including Dr Antonio Pardinas, Dr Leon Hubbard, Dr Thomas Massey and Prof. Michael O'Donovan, along with expressing my gratitude for the support and camaraderie of my team colleagues, Dr Ellis Pires and Dr Lynsey Hall.
#
# I also express my heartfelt appreciation to my parents, Ros and Paul. Their love, sacrifices and support over the years have certainly nurtured the personal potential to undertake this challenge. Even though my father's passing during the course of this project has left an irreplaceable void, his memory has continued to inspire me to push on to the end.
#
# Finally, the most special form of thanks belongs to my awesome family - Teresa, Emily and Sophie, for being with me throughout. Even though you have always taken priority, you have generously gifted the time for me to complete this endeavour and for that I will forever be grateful.
